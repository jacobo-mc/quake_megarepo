# About this version

This version was extracted from the PDFs which were [released by Michael Abrash and Dr. Dobbs in 2001](http://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/graphics-programming-black-book/184404919). The intention is to maintain a canonical electronic version of the book, and make it easier to read in other formats and on other devices than were available when the book was released online.
