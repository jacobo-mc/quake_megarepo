## Chapter 46 -- Who Was that Masked Image?

### Optimizing Dirty-Rectangle Animation

Programming is, by and large, a linear process. One statement or
instruction follows another, in predictable sequences, with tiny
building blocks strung together to make thinking, which is, of course, A
Good Thing. Still, it's important to keep in mind that there's a large
chunk of the human mind that doesn't work in a linear fashion.

I've written elsewhere about the virtues of
nonlinear/right-brain/lateral/what-have-you thinking in solving tough
programming problems, such as debugging or optimization, but it bears
repeating. The mind can be an awesome pattern-matching and extrapolation
tool, if you let it. For example, the other day was grinding my way
through a particularly difficult bit of debugging. The code had been
written by someone else, and, to my mind, there's nothing worse than
debugging someone else's code; there's always the nasty feeling that you
don't quite know what's going on. The overall operation of this code
wouldn't come clear in my head, no matter how long stared at it, leaving
me with a rising sense of frustration and a determination not to quit
until got this bug.

In the midst of this, a coworker poked his head through the door and
told me he had something had to listen to. Reluctantly, went to his
office, whereupon he played a tape of what is surely one of the most
bizarre 911 calls in history. No doubt some of you have heard this tape,
which will briefly describe as involving a deer destroying the interior
of a car and biting a man in the neck. Perhaps you found it funny,
perhaps not—but as for me, it hit me exactly right. started laughing
helplessly, tears rolling down my face. When went back to
work—presto!—the pieces of the debugging puzzle had come together in my
head, and the work went quickly and easily.

Obviously, my mind needed a break from linear, left-brain, push-it-out
thinking, so it could do the sort of integrating work it does so
well—but that it's rarely willing to do under conscious control. It was
exactly this sort of thinking had in mind when titled my 1989
optimization book of *Zen of Assembly Language.* (Although must admit
that few people seem to have gotten the connection, and I've had to
field a lot of questions about whether I'm a Zen disciple. I'm
not—actually, I'm more of a Dave Barry disciple. If you don't know who
Dave Barry is, you should; he's good for your right brain.) Give your
mind a break once in a while, and I'll bet you'll find you're more
productive.

We're strange thinking machines, but we're the best ones yet invented,
and it's worth learning how to tap our full potential. And with that,
it's back to dirty-rectangle animation.

#### Dirty-Rectangle Animation, Continued

In the last chapter, Introduced the idea of dirty-rectangle animation.
This technique is an alternative to page flipping that's capable of
producing animation of very high visual quality, without any help at all
from video hardware, and without the need for any extra, nondisplayed
video memory. This makes dirty-rectangle animation more widely usable
than page flipping, because many adapters don't support page flipping.
Dirty-rectangle animation also tends to be simpler to implement than
page flipping, because there's only one bitmap to keep track of. A final
advantage of dirty-rectangle animation is that it's potentially somewhat
faster than page flipping, because display-memory accesses can
theoretically be reduced to exactly one access for each pixel that
changes from one frame to the next.

The speed advantage of dirty-rectangle animation was entirely
theoretical in the previous chapter, because the implementation was
completely in C, and because no attempt was made to minimize display
memory accesses. The visual quality of Chapter 45's animation was also
less than ideal, for reasons we'll explore shortly. The code in Listings
46.1 and 46.2 addresses the shortcomings of Chapter 45's code.

Listing 46.2 implements the low-level drawing routines in assembly
language, which boosts performance a good deal. For maximum performance,
it would be worthwhile to convert more of Listing 46.1 into assembly, so
a call isn't required for each animated image, and overall performance
could be improved by streamlining the C code, but Listing 46.2 goes a
long way toward boosting animation speed. This program now supports
snappy animation of 15 images (as opposed to 10 for the software
presented in the last chapter), and the images are now two pixels wider.
That level of performance is all the more impressive considering that
for this chapter I've converted the code from using rectangular images
to using masked images.

#### Masked Images

Masked images are rendered by drawing an object's pixels through a mask;
pixels are actually drawn only where the mask specifies that drawing is
allowed. This makes it possible to draw nonrectangular objects that
don't improperly interfere with one another when they overlap. Masked
images also make it possible to have transparent areas (windows) within
objects. Masked images produce far more realistic animation than do
rectangular images, and therefore are more desirable. Unfortunately,
masked images are also considerably slower to draw—however, a good
assembly language implementation can go a long way toward making masked
images draw rapidly enough, as illustrated by this chapter's code.
(Masked images are also known as *sprites*; some video hardware supports
sprites directly, but on the PC it's necessary to handle sprites in
software.)

Masked images make it possible to render scenes so that a given image
convincingly appears to be in front of or behind other images; that is,
so images are displayed in *z-order* (by distance). By consistently
drawing images that are supposed to be farther away before drawing
nearer images, the nearer images will appear in front of the other
images, and because masked images draw only precisely the correct pixels
(as opposed to blank pixels in the bounding rectangle), there's no
interference between overlapping images to destroy the illusion.

In this chapter, I've used the approach of having separate, paired masks
and images. Another, quite different approach to masking is to specify a
transparent color for copying, and copy only those pixels that are not
the transparent color. This has the advantage of not requiring separate
mask data, so it's more compact, and the code to implement this is a
little less complex than the full masking I've implemented. On the other
hand, the transparent color approach is less flexible because it makes
one color undrawable. Also, with a transparent color, it's not possible
to keep the same base image but use different masks, because the mask
information is embedded in the image data.

#### Internal Animation

I've added another feature essential to producing convincing animation:
*internal animation*, which is the process of changing the appearance of
a given object over time, as distinguished from changing only the
*location* of a given object. Internal animation makes images look
active and alive. I've implemented the simplest possible form of
internal animation in Listing 46.1—alternation between two images—but
even this level of internal animation greatly improves the feel of the
overall animation. You could easily increase the number of images cycled
through, simply by increasing the value of `InternalAnimateMax` for a
given entity. You could also implement more complex image-selection
logic to produce more interesting and less predictable
internal-animation effects, such as jumping, ducking, running, and the
like.

#### Dirty-Rectangle Management

As mentioned above, dirty-rectangle animation makes it possible to
access display memory a minimum number of times. The previous chapter's
code didn't do any of that; instead, it copied all portions of every
dirty rectangle to the screen, regardless of overlap between rectangles.
The code I've presented in this chapter goes to the other extreme,
taking great pains never to draw overlapped portions of rectangles more
than once. This is accomplished by checking for overlap whenever a
rectangle is to be added to the dirty list. When overlap with an
existing rectangle is detected, the new rectangle is reduced to between
zero and four nonoverlapping rectangles. Those rectangles are then again
considered for addition to the dirty list, and may again be reduced, if
additional overlap is detected.

A good deal of code is required to generate a fully nonoverlapped dirty
list. Is it worth it? It certainly can be, but in the case of Listing
46.1, probably not. For one thing, you'd need larger, heavily overlapped
objects for this approach to pay off big. Besides, this program is
mostly in C, and spends a lot of time doing things other than actually
accessing display memory. It also takes a fair amount of time just to
generate the nonoverlapped list; the overhead of all the looping,
intersecting, and calling required to generate the list eats up a lot of
the benefits of accessing display memory less often. Nonetheless, fully
nonoverlapped drawing can be useful under the right circumstances, and
I've implemented it in Listing 46.1 so you'll have something to refer to
should you decide to go this route.

There are a couple of additional techniques you might try if you want to
wring maximum performance out of dirty-rectangle animation. You could
try coalescing rectangles as you generate the dirty-rectangle list. That
is, you could detect pairs of rectangles that can be joined together
into larger rectangles, so that fewer, larger rectangles would have to
be copied. This would boost the efficiency of the low-level copying
code, albeit at the cost of some cycles in the dirty-list management
code.

You might also try taking advantage of the natural coherence of animated
graphics screens. In particular, because the rectangle used to erase an
image at its old location often overlaps the rectangle within which the
image resides at its new location, you could just directly generate the
two or three nonoverlapped rectangles required to copy both the erase
rectangle and the new-image rectangle for any single moving image. The
calculation of these rectangles could be very efficient, given that you
know in advance the direction of motion of your images. Handling this
particular overlap case would eliminate most overlapped drawing, at a
minimal cost. You might then decide to ignore overlapped drawing between
different images, which tends to be both less common and more expensive
to identify and handle.

#### Drawing Order and Visual Quality

A final note on dirty-rectangle animation concerns the quality of the
displayed screen image. In the last chapter, we simply stuffed dirty
rectangles into a list in the order they became dirty, and then copied
all of the rectangles in that same order. Unfortunately, this caused all
of the erase rectangles to be copied first, followed by all of the
rectangles of the images at their new locations. Consequently, there was
a significant delay between the appearance of the erase rectangle for a
given image and the appearance of the new rectangle. A byproduct was the
fact that a partially complete—part old, part new—image was visible long
enough to be noticed. In short, although the pixels ended up correct,
they were in an intermediate, incorrect state for a sufficient period of
time to make the animation look wrong.

This violated a fundamental rule of animation: *No pixel should ever be
displayed in a perceptibly incorrect state*. To correct the problem,
I've sorted the dirty rectangles first by Y coordinate, and secondly by
X coordinate. This means the screen updates from to draw a given image
should be drawn nearly simultaneously. Run the code from the last
chapter and then this chapter; you'll see quite a difference in
appearance.

Avoid the trap of thinking animation is merely a matter of drawing the
right pixels, one after another. Animation is the art of drawing *the
right pixels at the right times* so that the eye and brain see what you
want them to see. Animation is a lot more challenging than merely
cranking out pixels, and it sure as heck isn't a purely linear process.
