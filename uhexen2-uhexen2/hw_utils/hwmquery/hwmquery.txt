HWMQUERY v0.2.3

Usage:  hwmquery <address>[:port]

This tiny console application queries a hexenworld master server and
lists the servers that it has registered without processing. It uses
26900 as the default master server port. It is aimed mainly for linux
(unix) users, but works just as fine on windows, too.

BUGS
None. Please report, if you find any.
