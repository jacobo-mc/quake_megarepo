NAME
	hwrcon -- HexenWorld Remote CONsole

SYNOPSIS
	hwrcon ipaddress[:port] password commands ...

DESCRIPTION
	This is a remote interface to the HexenWorld rcon command.
	It acts as a light-weight hexenworld client that will send
	rcon commands on your behalf.  It will send only one command
	at a time.  This allows you to administer the server without
	being at the console, and without starting a full hexenworld
	client.  It can also be embedded in shell scripts and linux
	cron jobs.  It is aimed mainly for linux (unix) users, but
	works just as fine on windows, too.

OPTIONS
	None.

SEE ALSO
	hwterm - Interactive version of hwrcon
	tail(1) - output the last part of files

NOTES
	You need to know the rcon_password to use this program on a
	server.  It will not return ANY RESPONSES!!  You might think
	that you could just tail the server log. (log_file 2) This
	is a neat idea, but it doesn't work either, unless you operate
	your command through an alias.
	   alias whatsup status
	   set rcon_password boom

	   $ hwrcon 127.0.0.1 boom whatsup

	This will produce output on the console log.  Note that hwrcon
	will not pull out this output, however.
