NAME
	HWTerm -- HexenWorld Remote Console Terminal

SYNOPSIS
	hwterm ipaddress[:port] password

DESCRIPTION
	This is a remote terminal that acts similar to the console
	of a hexenworld server, using the RCON interface. It acts as
	a light-weight hexenworld client that will send rcon commands
	on your behalf.  This allows you to administer the server
	without being at the console, and without starting a full
	hexenworld client.  As a neat side effect, CTRL-D will resend
	the last command.  Use CTRL-C to quit. It is aimed mainly for
	linux (unix) users, but works just as fine on windows, too.

OPTIONS
	None.

SEE ALSO
	hwrcon - Command line version of hwterm
	tail(1) - output the last part of files

NOTES
	You need to know the rcon_password to use this program on a
	server.  It will return the responses from the server, as well.
	You might think that you could just tail the server log
	(log_file 2). This is a neat idea, but it doesn't work either,
	unless you operate your command through an alias.
	   alias whatsup status
	   set rcon_password boom

	   $ hwterm 127.0.0.1 boom
	   whatsup

	This will produce output on the console log.  You may use
	tail(1) in another window.
