Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uHexen2)

Known issues:
-------------------------------------

- Unix (SDL) client: Hitting the ESC key to open the menu several times
  or opening and closing the game console several times may result in a
  freeze or an endless loop.
  This is NOT a uhexen2 bug, but an SDL-1.2 bug in its X11 backend:
  https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL-1.2/issues/744
  The issue triggers if you have an IME running and XMODIFIERS is set.
  The bug is already fixed in the mainstream SDL repo:
  https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL-1.2/commit/0332e2bb18dc68d6892c3b653b2547afe323854b
  To solve the problem: either recompile SDL to incorporate the fix, or
  unset XMODIFIERS to work around it.

- h2ded (dedicated server) coop mode issues: sf.net/p/uhexen2/bugs/52/
  - Skull wizards may become non-solid and invincible after they blink
    away and come back.
  - Dark Pharaoh's staff would disappear after pushing the switch that
    lowers it.
  - Loading saves may often result in bugs.
  Issues don't seem to happen with "h2 -dedicated".  To be analyzed.

- HexenWorld: Coop mode is broken. Known problem since Raven's latest
  beta versions.

- OpenGL: Shadows have always been broken (they need a major rework to
  fix) and are disabled by default.

- 3dfx Voodoo:  Palettized textures are broken with the old unmodified
  Mesa 3.x drivers. The new Mesa-6.2 drivers work fine. Windows people
  should use the latest "MesaFX" driver.
- 3dfx Voodoo: May not work correctly with multitexturing when running
  with gl_luminance lightmaps. This is a 3dfx limitation.
- 3dfx Voodoo, Windows:  3dfx minigl drivers shall not work properly,
  because their glGenTextures() implementation is broken and we rely
  on that function. Use 3dfx OpenGL ICD or "MesaFX" drivers, instead.
