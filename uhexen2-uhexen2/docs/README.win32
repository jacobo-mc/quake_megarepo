Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion  (uHexen2)

Installation Instructions for Windows:
--------------------------------------

Install Hexen II from your cdrom, first. Apply the official 1.11 patch
of Raven software (you need a file named "ph2v111.exe", see gamers.org
mirros: http://www.gamers.org/pub/idgames2/hexen2/official/patch/ )

If you want the mission pack and/or hexenworld, install them, too.

NOTE: The Hexen II cdrom installer puts a file named opengl32.dll
into the installation folder: This is a 3dfx-specific opengl mini
driver for old Voodoo cards only and you want to delete this file
unless you are using one of those very old cards. If you get an error
message like "glide2x.dll not found", then this is the reason!

Now extract the Hammer of Thyrion package into your installation
folder. You must allow overwriting the existing files. It contains
all of the updated program files and gamedata.  You no longer need
h2mp.exe and glh2mp.exe: they are obsoleted, you can delete them.
Run the game as you normally would.

To play the mission pack, run the game with a "-portals" commandline
switch (without the quotes, of course). For example:

    h2 -portals
or
    glh2 -portals

If you want to automate this, change the mission pack game entries in
your windows start menu, by using the "properties" right-click option
on them: Change all "glh2mp.exe" into "glh2.exe -portals" and all of
"h2mp.exe" into "h2.exe -portals".
