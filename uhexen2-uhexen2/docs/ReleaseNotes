========================================================================
Changes in v1.5.8a (Aug. 28, 2016)
========================================================================

This is a post-release patch against v1.5.8 fixing a few Amiga issues:

- Amiga sound (AHI backend): fix sample rates lower than 11025 Hz.

- Amiga sound (AHI backend): fix bad sound with sample rates which are
  not a multiple of 11025.

- Amiga input: limit lowlevel.library joystick ports to 0-3.

- AmigaOS3, MiniGL: smart and automatic locking support.  New cvar:
  gl_lockmode, valid values: "manual" (default), "auto", and "smart".


========================================================================
Changes in v1.5.8: (Aug. 12, 2016.)
========================================================================

This is a minor bug fix and maintenance release:

- Software renderer: Fixed a reported crash if the engine is compiled
  with certain Visual Studio versions (bug #62.)

- Software renderer: Fixed sky scaling issues, thanks to Szilard Biro.
 (fix found in 'ToChriS' quake source.)

- Software renderer: Fixed scaling console backgrounds whose dimensions
  are not the default 320x200. One such example is the "Game of Tomes"
  mod which has a 1024x768 conback.lmp.

- Hexenworld server: Added "-protocol x" command line option to force
  the server to use a specific protocol (25 or 26), if so required.

- Amiga: Video fixes. On AROS, the game does not 'freeze' in fullscreen
  mode anymore if the 'Timidity:' assign is not present.

- Amiga: m68k-amigaos support. (Use VBCC as the compiler, gcc has code
  generation issues.)

- Windows: Visual Studio builds no longer require yasm or nasm. Tested
  compilation using VS2015-update/2.

- DOS, PCI sound driver: Updates, more Intel HDA chipsets recognized.

- DOS, 3dfx opengl: Macronix (MX86251) variants of Voodoo Rush boards
  are now functional.

- DOS, 3dfx opengl: Further updates/fixes to opengl and glide drivers.
  Updates to DXE exports so that more opengl driver builds would work
  without requiring an engine recompile.

- All platforms, gameplay: Fixed an issue with the rider bosses Death,
  Pestilence and War in coop mode. (as reported by Spike and Korax.)

- Other minor fixes/tidy-ups elsewhere in the source.


========================================================================
Changes in v1.5.7: (Jan. 10, 2016.)
========================================================================

- All platforms, gameplay, mission pack: fixed an hcode bug which would
  make the spiders seemingly invincible for a difficulty-depending time.

- All platforms, gameplay: Crusader partial heal at certain experience
  thresholds now starts at level 3 to be consistent with the manual.

- All platforms, gameplay: Many small HexenC fixes and clean-ups.

- All platforms, hexen2: Better cross-map demo playback support.

- OpenGL: fix screenshots when screen width isn't a multiple of 4.

- OpenGL: minor gamma updates.

- Windows: fixed DPI scaling issues.

- Windows, CD audio: fixed the "-cddev" command line option.

- Music: Support for FLAC codec and tracker (MOD) music including unreal
  umx files. (edit the makefiles to enable when compiling.)

- Utils, hcc: Added a command line option "-os" to compact the strings
  heap by eliminating duplicates. some minor revisions.

- Utils, jsh2color: ignore minlight values from the -light command line
  switch: eliminates the majority of the ugly black patches from eidolon
  and rider2c maps. bumped its version to 1.2.6.

- All platforms: External wal texture loading is now a compile time
  option, disabled by default.

- HexenWorld: Support for a new protocol 26: if the client sends '*cap'
  userinfo with a 'c', the server returns protocol 26 instead of 25 and
  sends the sound and model lists in small chunks like quakeworld does.
  Old clients versus new servers and new clients versus old servers are
  not affected and run using the original protocol 25 as they used to.
  The new protocol 26 connection sequence avoids packet fragmentation.

- DOS: HexenWorld is now supported on DOS. requires uhexen2 v1.5.7 or
  newer hexenworld servers to connect. (see above for hw protocol 26.)

- DOS: OpenGL support on 3Dfx Voodoo cards.

- DOS: Experimental support for several PCI sound cards (see README.dos)

- Several small fixes, tidy-ups, safeguards elsewhere in the sources.

- Added a shell script to run different versions of the game which can
  be useful for system-wide installations. (see scripts/hexen2-run.sh)

- Removed the gtk launcher.

- Updated third-party libraries (music codecs and SDL).


========================================================================
Changes in v1.5.6: (Mar. 15, 2013.)
========================================================================

- Screen: implemented Hor+ style field of view (FOV) scaling, useful for
  widescreen resolutions. configured by new cvar fov_adapt: set it to 1
  and your fov will be scaled automatically according to the resolution.
  enabled by default. opengl and software renderers both supported.

- Screen: viewsize greater than 120 now disables the hud (use the screen
  size slider in the options menu.)

- Progs VM: Fixed a corner case thinko in version6 progs execution.

- Server: changelevel failures, e.g. in case of non-existent maps, are
  now considered as error, so that the clients do not get stuck in the
  connected state anymore.

- Server: accept maplist.txt only if it is from the same game directory
  as progs.dat itself or from a searchpath with a higher priority.

- Timidity (Unix MIDI): Multiple fixes, including memory errors found by
  valgrind.

- Mac OS X: A new icon.

- Music: Support for Opus codec. (edit the makefiles to enable it when
  compiling.)

- Software renderer: fixed color shifts from area contents or power-up
  items usage staying persistent after a disconnect.

- OpenGL: worked around weird mods, e.g.: project peanut, where certain
  models are sometimes drawn "white" because the mod's hcode initializes
  those entities with non-existant skins.

- OpenGL: gamma fixes for several platforms.

- HexenWorld: opengl fixes for the shownames feature, other gl updates.

- Hexenworld, gamecode: hw and siege map cycling setup is done using the
  localinfo variables just like in quakeworld, strings.txt abusing is no
  more. See docs/README.hwsv for brief instructions.

- Verified correct compilation by upcoming gcc-4.8 and by clang-3.2.

- Fixed several other minor bugs, some found by valgrind. Incremented
  engine versions for hexen2 to 1.28, hexenworld to 0.28, and gamecode
  version to 1.28.


========================================================================
Changes in v1.5.5: (Jan. 02, 2013.)
========================================================================

- Utils (light, vis, jsh2color): Added unix pthreads support for running
  multi-threaded. Enabled windows multi-threads on all platforms instead
  of alpha-only. Default is single-threaded. Use "-threads #" to specify
  the required number of threads. (max: 32. -1 tries to autodetect.)

- Utils, qbsp: Added a command line option "-oldhullsize" to replicate
  the old h2utils/qbsp behavior of using the original hexen2 sizes for
  hulls #5 and #6, not H2MP ones, if so needed.

- Utils, hcc: Added a command line option "-old" to replicate old hcc
  versions' behavior of allowing the STR_ constants be saved globals and
  letting precache_file() calls go into progs.dat, if so needed.

- Utils, dcc: Some small fixes. Added new command line options -fields,
  -functions, -globaldefs, -prglobals, -statements and -strings, which
  dump the related information.

- Utils, all: Some fixes/improvements to command line options handling.

- Support for the rarely used progs version 7 spec with 32 bit offsets
  instead of 16 bit of the original version 6: The engine can run both
  with v6 as well as with v7 progs. The hcc and dhcc tools are changed
  to compile the progs as v6 whenever possible for compatibility, or as
  v7 otherwise. they can also be made to compile specifically v6 or v7
  progs by the new command line options -v6, -v7, or -version <n>. The
  dhcc tool can now decompile both v6 and v7 progs.

- Fixed a respawn-after-death issue which sometimes rendered the player
  unable to move backwards, or unable to use certain inventory items, or
  several other weird effects (bug #2176023.)  The bug was there since
  the original hexen2 source release.

- New quake2-style noclip movement. (from Fitzquake; configured by new
  cvar sv_altnoclip, enabled by default.)

- Client: Fixed a demo playback failure when certain conditions are met.

- Client: Fixed a minor and rare intermission glitch.

- Client: unbindall before loading stored bindings (configurable by new
  cvar cfg_unbindall, enabled by default.)

- SDL, keyboard input: Fixed control-character handling in unicode mode.

- All, keyboard input: Several tweaks.

- Software renderer: Disabled progress bars drawing, as it was reported
  to cause excessively long load times on some systems. Disabled the
  rotating skull drawing during file i/o.

- Software renderer: Fixed occasional crash when sprites rendered very
  close to the camera origin, such as the teleportation puff. (used to
  happen mostly in 64 bit builds. bug #3562290.)

- OpenGL: Fixed a crash in texture resampling code with 3d hardware max
  texture size greater than 1024 and wide-enough textures.

- Windows: Removed hooks for QHOST, which is (was) a proprietery server
  administation tool.

- Mac OS X: packages now have ogg/vorbis and mp3 music playback support.

- Mac OS X: New MIDI driver.

- Mac OS X: Support for text paste from OS clipboard to console. Support
  for the Apple (Command) key.

- Mac OS X: Support for building using the makefiles and cross-compiling
  from Linux.

- MorphOS builds: added missing -noixemul to the compiler flags.

- MorphOS, AROS, Amiga: Support text paste from OS clipboard to console.

- All platforms, gameplay: fixed bug in original hexen2 hcode which used
  to cause weapon switching to get stuck if several weapons were picked
  up too fast. fixed a minor bug in assassin's fourth weapon in powered
  mode. cleaned up weapon cycling code, minor fixes/clean-ups in weapon
  selection. fixed cube of force, so that it doesn't attack the player's
  own summoned imp anymore. several other hcode cleanups.

- All platforms, hexenworld: pak4.pak from the ancient beta 0.11 version
  is now recognized properly.

- All platforms, h2patch: Simplifications.

- Windows: support for Visual Studio 2012.

- All: Incremented versions for hexen2 engine to 1.27, hexenworld engine
  to 0.27, and gamecode version to 1.27.


========================================================================
Changes in v1.5.4: (July 01, 2012.)
========================================================================

- OpenGL:  Fixed screen flickering resulting from progress bars drawing
  with some drivers (bug #3519666.) uHexen2 no longer draws the loading
  progress bars during level load in opengl mode.

- OpenGL (Windows): Fixed a bug which would prevent running on Windows8
  consumer preview versions, unless 32 bit color depth was specified on
  the command line. Works just fine now.

- Music playback: Made sure that the file's channels count is supported.

- Unix MIDI (Timidity): Configuration file timidity.cfg is now searched
  first under the user directory and the installation directory before
  the common system locations. Full absolute path of timidity.cfg can be
  specified by setting the TIMIDITY_CFG environment variable, too.

- Client, all: Revised the intermissions setup code.

- Client, all: Fixed a few effect abslight and scale flags, which were
  another bunch of original hexen2source bugs.

- All platforms: Majorly revised path name handling and filesystem code.

- Support for Solaris. Support for Amiga, AROS, MorphOS. Added missing
  RISCOS defines.

- Keyboard input: Made the keypad keys to send separate key events in
  game mode. (for Windows and SDL-using builds, e.g. Linux/Unix, OSX.)

- Joystick: Added joystick (gamepad) support for all SDL-using builds,
  e.g. Linux/Unix, MacOSX. The new cvars are documented in the README.

- Mouse (DOS): Wheel is now detected and used by default. Use "-nowheel"
  command line switch to disable it.

- Mouse (DOS): Pausing the game, moving the mouse and then unpausing it
  doesn't change the view angle anymore.

- All platforms, gameplay: Fixed a rare crash in the ambient fish hcode.

- All platforms, h2patch: More detailed output and better reporting in
  case of incompatible or corrupted pak files. Same with the pak-patch
  functionality of the gtk-launcher application.

- Utils, dcc (progs decompiler): Fixed an infinite recursion issue when
  decompiling the hcbots progs.dat. Fixed decompiling of rival kingdoms
  progs. Changed decompiler memory usage. Made -src command line option
  of dhcc to behave the same as it does with hcc. Added -name command
  line option either for specifying a name other than progs.src for the
  compiler like hcc itself or for specifying a name other than progs.dat
  for the decompiler.

- Utils, hcc (HexenC compiler): Cleaned up the -src command line option
  handling.

- All: Incremented versions for the hexen2 engine to 1.26 and hexenworld
  engine to 0.26. Incremented gamecode version to 1.26.

- Several source code cleanups and documentation updates.


========================================================================
Changes in v1.5.3: (Apr. 10, 2012.)
========================================================================

- OpenGL: Made non-power-of-two textures support configurable by a cvar,
  gl_texture_NPOT, disabled by default:  Fixes serious slowdown on some
  old graphics hardware, such as R300 to R500 class Radeons on Mac OS X,
  which the driver is lying about its capability. Added a menu entry to
  enable/disable the feature (OpenGL features -> NPOT textures.)

- Sound: The client no longer tries updating the ambient sounds when not
  connected, ie. when no map is active.

- Several updates to the documentation.


========================================================================
Changes in v1.5.2: (Apr. 04, 2012.)
========================================================================

- All platforms: Incremented versions for the hexen2 engine to 1.25,
  hexenworld engine to 0.25, gamecode to 1.25 and the gtk-launcher to
  1.0.7.

  version 4.7.x.

- All platforms, gamecode: Fixed occasional crashes in the original
  hexen2 game with the Paladin's axe.

- All platforms, hexen2 net play: fixed connection getting stuck
  sometimes after displaying the "Connection accepted" message.

- All platforms: Ported server model code optimizations and cleanups
  from h2ded to hwsv (hexenworld server).

- All platforms: Added support for transparent console in the software
  renderer, controlled by new cvar "contrans". The valid values for
  contrans are 0 (solid), 1 (transparent) and 2 (very transparent).

- All platforms, software renderer: Fixed wrong transparency issue with
  certain models when not using the x86 assembler drawing routines.

- All platforms: Added on-screen fps counter to hexen2 (do "showfps 1"
  from the console).  Updated existing showfps code of hexenworld.

- All platforms, OpenGL: Added anisotropic texture filtering support
  (gl_texture_anisotropy). Revised existing texture filters. The texture
  filtering options now saved to the config.

- All platforms, OpenGL: Added support for non-power-of-two-textures
  extension.

- All platforms: Implemented fov in opengl hexen2, useful for widescreen
  resolutions. Revised the implementations in hexenworld, as well as the
  software renderer.

- All platforms, OpenGL: Fixed shadows spot which was broken back in
  2007 during v1.4.2 development.

- All platforms, input: Discard mouse/joystick motion when in camera
  mode. Discard the accumulated mouse motion when starting a game or
  when loading a saved game to prevent any unintended viewangle changes.

- Windows input: Disabled GDI mouse acceleration flags for better
  behavior on XP and newer versions.

- SDL / Unix: Revised SDL unicode and dead keys support.

- SDL / Mac OS X: Fixed console and message mode backspace key (bug
  #2688151.)

- Unix / SVGAlib mouse: Fixed missing camera mode and ideal roll

  vt switching.

- Unix: Fixed compilation on GNU/kFreeBSD (Debian, #657793)

- Unix, MIDI: Several updates to the Timidity backend.

- Timidity, Windows MIDI: Support for Microsoft RMID format.

- Windows MIDI: Fixed broken tempo with certain midi files (problem was
  introduced in version 1.5.1)

- Windows software renderer: Fixed restoring of the saved video mode on
  startup (problem was introduced in v1.4.4.)

- Windows software renderer: Disabled MGL DirectDraw support by default
  (causes more trouble than it's actually worth.) Can be enabled by
  -useddraw or -usedirectdraw command line switches, if required.

- All platforms: Revised the cross-episode demo recording and playback
  behavior, allowing the intermission screens to be displayed.

- All platforms: Removed code that prevented deathmatch and coop cvars
  to be set at the same time, which was reported for possibility of
  causing compatibility issues with mods.

- All platforms: Majorly revised the support mechanism for different
  versions of progs. Added old v1.03 progs support to hexen2, added old
  v0.11 and v0.14 progs support to hw.

- All platforms, h2ded: Removed error when neither coop nor deathmatch
  is set and rely on server admin.

  library. (doesn't work yet due to WatTCP bugs.)

- DOS: Added "-nogus" command line option so that UltraSound initializa-
  tion can be skipped by the user if necessary.

- Miscellaneous source code cleanups.


========================================================================

========================================================================
Changes in v1.5.0: (Sep. 15, 2011.)
========================================================================

- bumped hexen2 engine version to 1.23, and hexenworld engine version to
  0.23. bumped the gamecode version to 1.20.

- added support for ogg, mp3 and wav external music files to be played
  instead of the original midi files.

- added interface for music streams to the sound layer and dropped the
  SDL_mixer dependency. many changes in sound and midi layer.  imported
  libtimidity into the source tree and applied several fixes.

- sound: changed internal driver interface to provide a better chance of
  engine startup with sound, especially for linux (unix) users.

- unix midi: reimplemented through the new music streams interface using
  timidity.

- windows midi: ignore midi hardware volume adjustment capability under
  windows vista/7 which fixes music volume control messing with the main
  volume.

- fixed a bug in multiple zones management, which wasn't easy to hit but
  was deadly when it was hit.

- fixed an old game load/save corruption bug.

- fixed an old load bug where items dropped by monsters not being
  visible or getting lost upon saving and loading the game.

- fixed an old load bug where prize artifacts in the Temple of Mars not
  being visible or getting lost upon saving and loading the game or by
  changing the level and reentering.

- fixed an old load bug where killed monsters didnt respawn in nightmare
  difficulty in the mission pack upon saving and loading the game or by
  changing the level and reentering.

- software renderer (C-only): fixed a segmentation fault with Crusader's
  ice mace.

- software renderer: fixed crashes at high resolutions with r_waterwarp
  enabled.

- added new cvar sys_throttle in order to throttle the game loop just a
  little bit and run cooler on new fast systems. the default value of
  sys_throttle is 0.02, acceptable values are between 0 and 1. changing
  it to 0 disables throttling.

- opengl: fixed overlapping flickering textures, i.e. the infamous brush
  model Z-fighting. the fix is controlled by gl_zfix: default value is 1
  (enabled). setting it to 0 disables the fix and brings back the old
  behaviour.

- opengl: always use GL_LINEAR as lightmap filter. made gl_texturemode
  command not affect lightmaps.

- opengl: fixed an issue in net games where joining players would appear
  untextured (bug #3288081).

- opengl: updated code to use glGenTextures().

- joystick, windows: added support for 6th joystick axis for up movement
  controlled by joyupthreshold and joyupsensitivity.

- fixed hexenworld server issue which used to crash servers upon running
  the romeric5 (Temple of Mars) map, which now loads fine.

  on the weapon racks in the demo2 and the village1 levels would be
  placed incorrectly (bug #3344613).

- hexenworld server: fixed segmentation fault in case of bad pointers in
  NUM_FOR_EDICT()

- fixed HexenC bug where, if there were a summoned imp around, a blinked
  away wizard wouldn't reappear even after imp went away (bug #3314808).

- fixed a HexenC bug where the summoned imp didn't pick the Egypt snake
  boss as an enemy (bug #3314810).

- improved soul spheres' HexenC code.

- fixed a HexenC bug where medusa's gaze attack sound would persist when
  she is dead.

- fixed an Eidolon/imp HexenC bug which used to render Eidolon idle.

- fixed a HexenC bug which would prevent a yakman from appearing during
  the 'Trial of Strength' in the 'Temple of Phurbu' (tibet7) level of
  the mission pack, rendering the level not completable (bug #1112533).

- fixed a mission pack HexenC bug where a pentacle monster in the tibet1
  map became invulnerable when it got crushed by a door.

- fixed a wheel of ages message to report 360 degrees instead of 30 in
  the egypt2 map.

- fixed a HexenC bug which might prevent Eidolon to land.

- fixed an Eidolon HexenC bug which might prevent the finale screen to
  trigger.

- fixed a HexenC bug where werepanthers became "undead" when an assassin
  killed them by her bombs.

- fixed mission pack HexenC bug which used to prevent the finale screen
  to trigger if Praevus were killed too quickly.

  and Keith Rozett.

- fixed trigger_crosslevel issue with spawnflag 8 which used to prevent
  one of the prizes in Temple of Mars to appear.

- removed the ugly hack of reducing teleport push speed to 225 in order
  to overcome the problem of reaching the Cathedral's balcony and the
  holy cross, and added a modified entities file for the Cathedral map
  instead.

- added support for external entity file loading which makes it easy to
  handle map quirks.  ent files are accepted only if they come from the
  same game directory as the map itself or from a searchpath with a
  higher priority. external entities loading is controlled by the cvar
  external_ents: default value is 1 (enabled). setting it to 0 disables
  external entities.

- revised lit file loading. lit files are now accepted only if they come
  from the same game directory as the map itself or from a searchpath
  with a higher priority.

- added new h2patch tool, an easy to use xdelta3-based standalone pak
  patch tool for purposes of updating to hexen2 v1.11 data files.
  updated the gtk-launcher's patch facility to use the same backend.

- utils, hcc: fixed broken switch statement compilation when there is an
  implicit break in the last case.

- utils, dcc: fixed a wrong decompilation of an "if" opcode into a
  "while". some source code revision.

- utils, hcc: dropped support for the old version of hcc tool.

- tested compilation using Visual Studio 2010.

- source directory layout reworked, repository moved from cvs to svn.

* Changes since v1.4.3 mostly during the unreleased 1.4.4-beta cycle:

- fixed broken software renderer binaries from C++ compilers with x86
  assembly enabled (do not use the bool keyword of C++).

- compilations using the new gcc-4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 versions are tested
  and supported.

- added support for 64 bit windows versions (x64).

- added support for mingw-w64 compilers.

- filesystem: fixed an oversight with builds without user directories,
  where the "-basedir" command line argument failed to change the
  internal userdir variables.

- fixed stuffcmds so that arguments to commands can have '-' or '+'
  within their names.  A command like "hexen2 +map mymap-01" works
  properly now.

- increased default zone memory size to 384kb.

- fixed a rare segmentation fault with certain command line arguments
  (bug was introduced sometime between version 1.3.0 and 1.4.0).

- fixed a problem in sound effects code where some teleportation sounds
  might have got lost.

- alsa audio: added workarouds for better behavior on some linux setups.

- hexen2 client: pause/resume midi (background music) along with cdaudio
  upon pause message.

- fixed the colored prints of hexenworld console.

- fixed 'array going out-of-bounds' (utils/map.c) and bogus 'maybe used
  uninitialized' warnings (sbar.c) from gcc-4.3.

- fixes to the SVGALib driver. it is functional now, both for hexen2 and
  for hexenworld clients.

- fixed bug #2176384: in windowed mode, when you save using the menus,
  the game used to quit the menu without grabbing the mouse properly.

- windows mouse: fixed behavior upon minimize/restore in windowed mode.

- slightly increased the buffersize for sdl audio. made it to print a
  little more detailed info at startup.

  play at the same time.

- launcher, patching: rewritten the inter-threads log printing and fixed
  the erratic crashes on smp systems. launcher version is 1.0.5 now.

  hexdump. hwmaster version is 1.2.6 now.

- 3dfx gamma hacks are disabled by default at compile time (see the
  Makefile).

- killed compatibility with user directories from HoT-1.4.0 and earlier
  which didn't operate with a data1 subdirectory. they are ancient
  history now.

  patch.

- utils, jsh2color: worked around a stack corruption resulting in
  crashes due to the code's way of dealing with TEX_SPECIAL cases.

- utils, qbsp: accept more than one wad file specified in the value of
  the "wad" key. the wad file names must be separated by a semicolon.
  spaces are allowed in the file names. quoted paths aren't allowed.

- utils, qbsp: the absolute paths in wad values are not touched, ie. the
  paths beginning with a '/' on unix or with a drive specifying string
  like "C:\foo\bar.wad" on windows. all other values with no path
  information or relative path information are prefixed with the project
  path. this fixes the issues reported for qbsp usage from within
  worldcraft.

- added back some unused code for future reference.  removed some truly
  dead code.

- other minor fixes.
