This is the latest version of HCC, the hcode (HexenC) compiler.
use -oi, -on and -os to reduce the size of the progs.dat .

Run "hcc -h" to see the tool's command line options.

If you use this new version for compiling the progs for original
hexen2, do not use those switches for compatibility with old saves:
If you use the -oi and -on optimizations, loading old saves make
the engine to emit warnings at runtime which are actually harmless,
but annoying...
