2014-06-28 1.2.6 sezero
Changes since 1.2.5:
 * Ignore the worldminlight values from the "-light" command line
   switch: eliminates the majority of the ugly black patches from
   eidolon and rider2c maps. Several cleanups.

2012-07-14 1.2.5 sezero
Changes since 1.2.4:
 * support for running multi-threaded to reduce completion time on
   smp or multi-core machines.
 * several cleanups: the -lit and -force command line switches are
   now ignored. failing to open an external definition file is now
   treated as an error. removed several globals which have no real
   meaning in the tool. removed some unused functions.

2010-10-27 1.2.4 sezero
Changes since 1.2.3:
 * worked around a stack corruption resulting in crashes due to the
   code's way of dealing with TEX_SPECIAL cases by blindly changing
   SINGLEMAP definition from 18*18*4 to 64*64*4. this significantly
   increases the stack size requirement to approx. 3MB, which isn't
   ideal at all.

2006-09-19 1.2.3 sezero
Changes since 1.2.2:
 * added big-endian support.
 * misc clean-up.

2006-03-04 1.2.2 sezero
Changes since 1.2.1:
 * tex.c, tyrlie.c, tyrlite.h: moved external definition file
   stuff to tex.c. small tidy-ups in args parsing.
 * tyrlite.c: do not allow -the -nodefault switch to take effect
   if the external color definition file cannot be accessed.
 * entities.c: inserted a note about the fact that the effects of
   the -light argument being zeroed. to be examined.
 * made static function and variables static. a lot of coding style
   and whitespace clean-up.
 * tyrlite.h: bumped version to 1.2.2

2005-11-13 1.2.1 sezero
Changes since 1.2:
 * trace.c: fixed fpmath segfaults:
   With vec_t defined as double, the front and back stuff
   in TestLine() need to be vec_t as well:  While creating
   lit files for demo2 or castle4, the gcc compiled binaries
   segfault under either of these conditions:
   - the program is not compiled with the -ffast-math flag.
   - compiled with gcc v4 for arches >= pentiumpro: i686,
     pentium2, or pentium3 without the -msse -mfpmath=sse
     extra flags.
 * entities.c, ltface.c, mathlib.c, mathlib.h: more double/vec_t
   clean-up
 * bspfile.c: killed unnecessary mathlib.h include
 * bspfile.c, entities.c, entities.h, tyrlite.c: cosmetic stuff:
   report the name of the lit file when finished, better reporting
   of map name.
 * tyrlite.h: bumped version to 1.2.1

2005-10-18 1.2 sezero
Changes since the original author's 1.1:
 * coding style, whitespace / indentation clean-up.
   also removed unused light.h includes.
 * light.c, light.h, tyrlite.dsp, tyrlite.dsw, tyrlite.mak, tyrlite.ncb,
   tyrlite.opt, tyrlite.plg: removed unused files.
 * gnu.txt, COPYING: updated the gpl license file from gnu.org
 * data_unix/colour.sh, data_unix/colourCastle.sh, data_unix/colourDm.sh,
   data_unix/colourEgypt.sh, data_unix/colourMeso.sh, data_unix/colourRomeric.sh,
   data_unix/default.def, data_unix/hexen2.def, data_unix/hexen2castle.def,
   data_unix/hexen2egypt.def, data_unix/hexen2meso.def, data_unix/hexen2romeric.def:
   added unix-style versions of data files
 * Makefile, Makefile.mingw, build_cross_win32.sh: added makefiles and
   build scripts
 * Makefile, Makefile.mingw, bspfile.c, cmdlib.c, cmdlib.h, entities.c,
   ltface.c, mathlib.c, mathlib.h, tex.c, trace.c, tyrlite.c, tyrlite.h:
   made the initial unix port:
   - several include fixes
   - moved nested externs out of functions
   - fixed type-punning gcc4 warning in LoadBSPFile
   - removed several unnecessary functions from cmdlib
   - synced cmdlib to what we did in HoT main tree:
     strcasecmp/stricmp macros, endiannes stuff, getwd
     fixes, etc.
   - added an ioctl fucntion Sys_kbhit as a _kbhit() replacement
   - moved the DecisionTime thing to cmdlib where it belongs.
     added a simple _getch() replacement to it using getchar().
   - added a paranoid negative check before a sqrt() call
   - killed all unused variable warnings
   - removed several commented-out stuff
   - trying to print the map name through entity->message requires
     line number (entity->message)-1  to be read from strings.txt,
     therefore not worth the effort. commented it out. now printing
     the map file name, only.
   - merged CalcFaceExtentsNoErr into CalcFaceExtents
   - removed unused macros in ltface.c
   - added math optimization flag -ffast-math, which actually cures
     a segfault when coloring demo2.bsp. Also added -march=i586 and
     -fexpensive-optimizations flags.
   - removed unnecessary underscored versions of math functions in
     mathlib
   - converted VectorLenth() into a macro, in mathlib
   - added min/max macroes for unix
   - added fflush(stdout) calls after all printf() calls which don't
     print a newline.
   - probably a few other minor stuff.
   - bumped version to 1.2
