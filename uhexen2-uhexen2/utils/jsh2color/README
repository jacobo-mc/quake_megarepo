This is version 1.2.x of JsH2Colour.
------------------------------------

JsH2Colour is a modification of MHColour v0.5 (which, in turn, was
derived from Tyrlite v0.8), for use with Hexen II. It also uses code
from the Hexen II light utility. This particular version is a cleaned
up and updated for both linux/unix and windows operating systems.

This is a light coloring utility that generates .LIT files. Color is
based on the type of textures that are close to light source. Remember
that JsH2Colour is NOT a replacement light utility:  It is intended to
be used on an existing BSP as a method of getting colored light.

You can define colors for texture based coloring in an external file
instead of having to define it in source code and recompiling it. To
specify external definition file use -external switch with name of file
as the parameter.

JsH2Colour contains default values for a subset of Hexen II texture sets
built into the source code. In case you don't want to use them, you can
prevent it by using -nodefault switch on command line. I recomend this
approach, because it enables you to set light color values individualy
for each map. Example files are included in distribution. Definition in
an external file doesn't replace the built-in definition for the same
texture unless you use the -nodefault switch AND define all the textures
you want to use in coloring process externaly. I have exported all the
default settings for built-in textures into the file default.def .

New command line switches :
---------------------------

-force
If JsH2Colour decides that the coloring process will be ineffective,
you will get an option to abandon ship. Use -force to override this and
always continue, but don't say I didn't warn you if you don't like what
you see.

-external FILENAME
Turns on the usage of external light color definition file. External
definition file name (FILENAME) must be specified.

-nodefault
Suppress the usage of built-in light color definition for default texture
sets. Useful if you want to use light coloring for only limited subset of
textures. Those to be used then must be defined in an external definition
file.

Format of external light color definition file:
------------------------------------------------
It is pretty simple. Each entry is on a new line. Each entry starts with
the texture name (just a string without qoutes) and is followed by color
triplet eg. red, green and blue components (integer numbers in range the
of 0-255. They are separated by space. All entries end with a newline char
(cr,lf).

texture_name red_val green_val blue_val	<newline>
[1-64 chars] [0-255] [0-255] [0-255] 

Example:
--------
*lava000 255 100 10
*lowlight 128 128 196
*skulls 255 10 10
+0rune1 255 10 10
+0rune2 255 255 128
marble 200 100 60
marbleseam 200 100 60
mtex402 10 128 10

The file default.def contains the built-in values in external form.
