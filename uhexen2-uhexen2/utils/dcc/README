progs.dat compiler/decompiler for Hexen2 by Eric Hobbs.  Read the author's
dcc.txt file for usage/details.

Run "dhcc -h" to see the tool's command line options.

Probably only interesting due to its decompiler facility.  There may be a
few very old and rare mods out there which can only be compiled by dhcc,
too, such as the HexenC code of "Project Peanut".

I put this here mostly for reference, but it is really useful due to its
decompiler facility.

If you ever intend to use dhcc to actually compile hcode, know that it was
created at a time when the official hcc had not been released, therefore it
has its own issues.  Here are its differences from official hcc:

- doesn't know about switch statements (can't decompile them, either)
- doesn't use/understand unions, uses its own "alias" instead
- uses random instead of randomv
- uses AdvanceThinktime(entity,float) instead of thinktime entity:float
- uses "|=" instead of "(+)"
- uses "^=" instead of "(-)"
- uses "x->y" instead of "x[y]" for array elements

(This isn't a complete and accurate list, but a list of things that just
came to my mind...)
