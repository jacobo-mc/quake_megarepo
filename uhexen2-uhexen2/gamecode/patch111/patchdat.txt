The patchdat directory contains binary patches to update the 1.03 cdrom
versions of hexen2 pak files to the latest 1.11 version.  This update is
actually the same as Raven's 1.11 update.

The delta files were generated using xdelta3-3.0.0 with the following
commands:
	xdelta3 -W 2097152 -0 -s cdrom/pak0.pak pak0.pak data1pk0.xd3
	xdelta3 -W 4194304 -0 -s cdrom/pak1.pak pak1.pak data1pk1.xd3
As seen from the command lines, 2 MB and 4MB input sizes were used.

In order to apply, use our "h2patch" program.

If you want to apply the patches using xdelta3 itself, do something like:
xdelta3 -f -d -s cdrom/pak0.pak patchdat/data1/data1pk0.xd3 data1/pak0.pak
xdelta3 -f -d -s cdrom/pak1.pak patchdat/data1/data1pk1.xd3 data1/pak1.pak
(You can get xdelta3 from http://xdelta.org/)
