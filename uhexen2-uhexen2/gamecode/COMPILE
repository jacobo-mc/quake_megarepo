In order to compile the hcode (the HexenC *.hc files) into the progs.dat
files, you need the hcc program (the hcode compiler). You can find the
sources for this utility either in released uhexen2 sources, or in the
uhexen2 svn repository.

In order to compile the original hexen2 hcode, don't use the -oi and -on
command line switches of hcc for compatibility with old saved games.  If
you use the -oi and -on optimizations, loading old saves make the engine
to emit warnings at runtime. They are actually harmless, but annoying...

$  hcc -os				# this compiles progs.dat
$  hcc -os -name progs2.src		# this compiles progs2.dat

In order to compile the mission pack, hexenworld or siege hcode, do:

$  hcc -os -oi -on
