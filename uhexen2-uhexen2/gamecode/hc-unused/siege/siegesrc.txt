Ok, here's all the source code for Siege.  It's not pretty,
it hasn't been tidied up or anything, so don't be
surprised if you see some really weird hacks and no comments.

The progs.src shows which files are to be included by hccmp.exe
when building the hwprogs.dat.  This also has at the top the path
(if any) and filename to use when making the hwprogs.dat

Also included is the latest compiler, hccmp.exe, my batch
file I use for compiling, and my MSDEV workspace files if
you want to use them...

Any questions?  If they can be answered with a yes or
no, definitely e-mail me, otherwise, you can e-mail me but
I can't promise a swift response...
