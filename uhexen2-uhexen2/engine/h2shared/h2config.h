/* ====================================================================
   ENDIAN_RUNTIME_DETECT
   Value  :	0 or 1
   Affects:	everywhere in all source using byte order functions.

   This option has to be edited in the file q_endian.h, NOT here !!!
   Default is off which is a little bit faster.
   ================================================================== */


/* =====================================================================
   PARANOID
   Value  :	not a value, but a define or undef
   Affects:	allows paranoid checks at many places: speed sapping
		error checking.  do NOT enable this unless you REALLY
		know what you are doing: many of those checks may not
		be actually necessary and the game would error out at
		any time!  besides, it really decreases the speed.
   =================================================================== */

/* =====================================================================
   DO_USERDIRS
   Value  :	0 or 1
   Affects:	file system, quakefs.c.

   Allows separating user directories on multi-user systems. We HIGHLY
   recommend keeping it as 1. Also see "sys.h" where DO_USERDIRS may be
   disabled on purpose for some platforms.

   DISALLOW_DEMONESS_IN_OLD_GAME

   Change the define below to 0 if you want to allow the demoness
   class in the old mission through the menu system.
   ================================================================== */
#define	DISALLOW_DEMONESS_IN_OLD_GAME	1


/* ====================================================================
   ENABLE_OLD_RETAIL
   Value  :	0 or 1
   Affects:	filesystem init.

   Allow running with the old, pre-1.11 (such as 1.03 cdrom) versions
   of Hexen II.  The game actually seems to run fine with the original
   cdrom version, but Raven's later patches provided several fixes for
   map/scripting bugs.  Therefore, running with the old version may or
   may not result in unexpected gameplay behavior.  (Here are the maps
   changed between v1.03 and v1.11: demo2, village1, village2, village3,
   meso1, meso8, egypt6, rider2c, cath, tower, eidolon, ravdm1, ravdm3,
   ravdm5.  Models: assassin.mdl, ball.mdl, bonelump.mdl, scrbpwng.mdl.
   Sounds: spider/step1.wav, step2.wav, step3.wav,  weapons/ric2.wav.)
   Default: disabled (0).
   ================================================================== */
#define	ENABLE_OLD_RETAIL		0


/* ====================================================================
   ENABLE_OLD_DEMO
   Value  :	0 or 1
   Affects:	filesystem init. other places.

   Allow running with the old (original) version of the Hexen II Demo
   from 28.8.1997: It was class-restricted, paladin and assassin only,
   as a result it lacked certain models. It didn't include the demo3
   (The Mill) level which the later (Nov. 1997, v1.11) of the demo had,
   but it had the Mill area merged in the demo1 map instead.
   It lacks certain models that our current progs precache, therefore,
   it must be run using ITS OWN progs which requires uhexen2 v1.5.2 or
   newer.
   Default: disabled (0).

/* ====================================================================
   H2MP
   Whether we want the mission pack support to be activated directly.
   Value  :	not a value, but a define or undef
   Affects:	quakefs.c (filesystem initialization)

   Default is no: player must use the -portals command line argument
   to activate it.  If you want direct activation, change the below
   undef to a define :  in that case, player must use the -noportals
   command line argument to disable mission pack support.

   Whether we want BSP2 format support. Default is enabled.

   NOTE: If you change this, remember to change both NASM and MASM
         versions worlda.inc !!!

   USE_AOT_FRICTION
   Value  :	0 or 1
   Affects:	sv_user.c (SV_UserFriction(), hexen2 only)

   Hexen II v1.11 progs does not initialize the friction properly:
   always 0.  In fact, applying a patch to the progs may solve this
   issue, but that would leave several unpatched mods as broken.
   Note: Compared to the AoT solution, the USE_AOT_FRICTION 0  option
   makes pure hexen2 to feel slightly more slippery.
   If you want to use the Anvil of Thyrion solution for the original
   hexen2 friction emulation, then define USE_AOT_FRICTION as 1,
   otherwise define it as 0.

   MGNET
   Value  :	not a value, but a define or undef
   Affects:	HexenWorld, server/sv_ents.c :: SV_WritePlayersToClient

   This doesn't ~seem~ to be in the latest binary release of Raven, but
   it is in the source release and the macro is defined in qwsv.dsp ie.
   the MSVC project file. It uses cardioid_rating() and might send an
   additional server message, svc_playerskipped.  The client calls
   CL_SavePlayer() upon receiving this message (see in cl_parse.c) but
   that code seems incomplete (see in cl_ents.c).  Enabling this option
   should require bumping the protocol version.  Disabled by default.

/* ====================================================================
   The amount of memory needed by Watt-32 (WatTCP) for DOS:
   - Hexen II server opens a socket for each client, plus it needs its
     accept socket and broadcast socket, so (MAX_PLAYERS + 3) * 11K is
     normally the maximum needed memory.
   - HexenWorld opens one socket, but it sends two large data, i.e. the
     soundlist and the modellist, in a single chunk, therefore WatTCP
     needs to allocate some additional memory (~ 2*64K?) to reassemble
     the fragmented data.
   Affects:	sys_dos.c.
   ================================================================== */

/* ====================================================================
   If CODECS_USE_ZONE is defined (see the Makefile), then mp3 (libmad)
   and ogg/vorbis codecs will allocate on the zone instead of system
   memory.  Remember that this requires recompiling the decoder library
   with proper memory allocator changes to it.  DOS builds are example
   for this case.  The memory requirements for individual decoders are
   defined below.
