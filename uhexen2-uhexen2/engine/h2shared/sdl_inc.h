2010-01-27:
SDL-1.3 is still in active development and its API hasn't solidified
yet.  As of this writing, SDL-1.2 and 1.3 has some api differences:
see, for example, SDL_GetMouseState() which is not binary compatible
between SDL-1.2 / 1.3: http://forums.libsdl.org/viewtopic.php?t=5458
For now, I am limiting our own requirement to the compiled version,
hence the SDL_NEW_VERSION_REJECT macro below.
