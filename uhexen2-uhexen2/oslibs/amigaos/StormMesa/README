StormMesa 3.x EGCS/GCC Version
-------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------

This is the EGCS/GCC adaption of the StormMesa 3.0 Shared Libraries. With
3.0, StormMesa finally went to shared libraries, including GLU, GLUT (including
the 3.7 stuff) and some other goodies. This archive contains everything you need
to use StormMesa with EGCS or GCC (from the GG distribution).

REQUIREMENTS
------------

EGCS or GCC from the Geek Gadgets ftp site
StormMesa archives (StMesa_Libs68K.lha will suffice).
Some GL programs

(to rebuild)
GNU Make
EGCS/GCC Fully working installation
an Assembler that can cope with the .s files (e.g. PhxAss)

INSTALLATION
------------

Manual:
	Copy libgl.a to /usr/lib
	make symbolic links to /usr/lib/libglu.a and /usr/lib/libglut.a

Automatic:
	type 'make install'

The library is installed as libgl.a as well as libglu.a and libglut.a
to keep configure scripts happy. Most of the time, you will not need to
edit the Makefiles, either.


REBUILDING
----------

You'll need a fully working GCC/EGCS environment to use this. In the directory,
type "make all" to build. You might need to adjust a few things in the makefile,
most notably the way the assembler files are translated. PhxAss works fine,
but most other assemblers should do (I had difficulties with SAS asm, though).
Afterwards, type "make install" to put the libgl.a into a place where it feels
all right.

USING
-----

Unpack the StormMesa distribution as normal. After installation, copy the
contents of include/GL to somewhere in your include path, for example to
/usr/include/GL/*.h

Now try getting a simle test program, like gears.c. Then enter the following:

gcc -O2 -o gears.o -c gears.c
gcc gears.o -o gears -lgl

This should build a 'gears' executable. Try it with "./gears".
You could also have used

gcc gears.o -o gears -lgl -lglu -lglut

but this is not strictly needed. Note that the startup code always opens
all StormMesa libraries, regardless of what's really used. Even linking
"only" against libgl will open them all, glu and glut are dummies, anyway.
