Notes about optimizing performance with MiniGL
30-06-02 by Christian Michael

Pay special attention to the following define in config.h:

CLAMP_COLORS : This enables color-clamping in glColor* functions. Clamping must be done where appropiate in the application if this is undefined.
Color clamping will usually only generate overhead so use
with care.

The define must be set when the linklibrary is compiled


The following glHint's should be noted:

MGL_W_ONE_HINT will enable/disable faster transformations in
cases where the w coordinate is equal to 1 (as with all
instances of glVertex3f)

GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT will NOT affect perspective mapping.
Use glDisable(MGL_PERSPECTIVE_MAPPING) to disable
perspective-correct texture-mapping


Last: Use the mglmacros.h if possible.
It will eliminate most of the API overhead associated with
vertexbuffer construction.
