Notes about guardband clipping:

MiniGL accepts a sort of guardband specified by:
mglChooseGuardBand(GL_TRUE); (default is GL_FALSE)

With guardband activated, MiniGL will bypass the clipping to
frustum borders in most cases if the viewport-border matches
the screenborder. Warp3D will then use scissoring for
clipping. This method is useful on current hardware
(603/604 PPC and Voodoo3) because fillrate never becomes a
bottleneck.

NOTE: Guardband may degrade performance on Permedia2.

mglChooseGuardband must be issued before mglCreateContext to
take effect, just like the other "choose" funcs.

The guardband is only used for some of the primitives.
