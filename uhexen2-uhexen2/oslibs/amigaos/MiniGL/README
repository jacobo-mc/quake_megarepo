MiniGL preliminary documentation
--------------------------------

MiniGL is  a  3D  API  which  is  compatible  to  OpenGL(tm).  It
implements  a  subset  of  that  API  and was designed for speed,
therefore it directly interfaces with  Warp3D.  This  also  means
that  there  is  currently  no  software mode.

Due to the speed issues, there are certain restrictions regarding
the  features  and  functions available. See the file "Functions"
for documentation.


Build instructions:
-------------------

gcc:

Two makefiles are provided, one for 68k, one for ppc.  Build  the
library  for  a  specific processor by make -f makefile.xxx, with
xxx being 68k or ppc. For StormC, just  load  the  project  files
from the Build directories.

The library is build in lib resp.  libppc.  Precompiled  versions
are available there.
