Using YASM with Visual Sudio 2008 and VC++ version 9
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Firstly you need to locate the directory (or directories) 
where the VC++ compiler binaries are located and put copies 
of the appropriate yasm.exe binary in these directories. A
typical location is:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin

Depending on your system you can use either the win32 or the
x64 version of YASM.

2. To use the new custom tools facility in Visual Studio 2008,
you need to place a copy of the yasm.rules file in the Visual 
Studio 2008 VC project defaults directory, which is typically 
located at:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC
  \VCProjectDefaults

This allows you to configure YASM as an assembler within the VC++
IDE. To use YASM in a project, right click on the project in the
Solution Explorer and select 'Custom Build Rules..'. This will 
give you a dialog box that allows you to select YASM as an 
assembler (note that your assembler files need to have the 
extension '.asm').

To assemble a file with YASM, select the Property Page for the 
file and the select 'Yasm Assembler' in the Tool dialog entry. 
Then click 'Apply' and an additional property page entry will 
appear and enable YASM settings to be established.

As alternative to placing the yasm.rules files as described 
above is to set the rules file path in the Visual Studio 2008
settings dialogue.


A Linker Issue
-----------------

There appears to be a linker bug in the VC++ v9 linker that 
prevents symbols with absolute addresses being linked in DLL 
builds.  This means, for example, that LEA instructions of 
the general form:

   lea, rax,[rax+symbol]

cannot be used for DLL builds.  The following general form 
has to be used instead:

   lea rcx,[symbol wrt rip]
   lea rax,[rax+rcx]

This limitation may also cause problems with other instruction 
that use absolute addresses.
