HISTORY:

2-24-01

First version of cartoon outline generator

3-1-01

Now vertex normals are recalculated based on which vertices are touching.
This keeps the outline from breaking along sharp edges.

3-27-01

Created map convertor from cartoon outline generator

4-7-01

Added Axis-Alignment Tolerance setting

4-9-01

Now tries to align texture using Quake Army Knife threepoints system
(also supported by Open Quartz compiling utilities)
