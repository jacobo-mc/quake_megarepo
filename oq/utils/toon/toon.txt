This utility currently only works on exported MilkShape 3D ASCII format models.
The homepage for MilkShape 3D is at: http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft
To view the outline in MilkShape 3D, import the generated model, right-click
in the 3D view, and un-check the "Draw Backfaces" option

HISTORY:

correct handling of parameters if the last parameter is -o [..] or -t [..]
