/* Explanation of values added to struct entity_s
 *
 * formula:
 *    takes a value 0-3 (default 0)
 *    0 - Standard lighting formula like original light
 *    1 - light fades as 1/x
 *    2 - light fades as 1/(x^2)
 *    3 - Light stays same brightness reguardless of distance
 *
 * atten:
 *    Takes a float as a value (default 1.0).
 *    This reflects how fast a light fades with distance.
 *    For example a value of 2 will fade twice as fast, and a value of 0.5
 *      will fade half as fast. (Just like arghlite)
 *
 *  mangle:
 *    If the entity is a light, then point the spotlight in this direction.
 *    If it is the worldspawn, then this is the sunlight mangle
 *
 *  lightcolor:
 *    Stores the RGB values to determine the light color
