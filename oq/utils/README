Building the Utilities
===============================================================================

Building on GNU/UNIX systems:

 1) run gmake

Building on Microsoft Windows:

 1) Install MinGW to get the gcc toolchain and gmake.
    You can download MinGW from http://www.mingw.org

 2) Download and compile libpng and zlib. 
    You can download both of these from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/
    See the README for instructions on how to build it.
	
 3) Tell the Open Quartz utilities where libpng and zlib are by
    setting the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS enviornment variables.
    For example, if you downloaded both to c:\openquartz, you would use:

      set CFLAGS=-Ic:/openquartz/lpng -Ic:/openquartz/zlib
      set LDFLAGS=-Lc:/openquartz/lpng -Lc:/openquartz/zlib

    Note the use of forward slashes.

 5) Delete the line in "Makefile" that adds "mkwad".  
    mkwad does not compile on Windows.

 6) Run make
