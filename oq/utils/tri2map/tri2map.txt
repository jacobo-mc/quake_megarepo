USAGE: tri2map [options] <file> [more options and/or files]

OPTIONS:

	-o [string] : output filename (NOTE: affects only the next input file)
	              (default = input filename but with .map extension)
	-h [float]  : horizontal scale (default = 64)
	-v [float]  : vertical   scale (default = 64)
	-s [float]  : sets both horizontal and vertical scale (default = 64)
	-x [float]  : X offset (lattitude) in Quake units (default = 0)
	-y [float]  : Y offset (longitude) in Quake units (default = 0)
	-z [float]  : Z offset (altitude)  in Quake units (default = 0)
	-f [float]  : height of brush bottoms in Quake units (default = -4096)
	-q          : use Quake Army Knife (QuArK)'s "three points"
	              texture alignment system to fit textures on faces
	              this float value is the number of texture pixels
	              to stretch along each edge of the triangles
