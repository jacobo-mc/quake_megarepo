<h1>Raw2map - Terrain Conversion</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/gg/raw2map.html">Raw2map</a>
is a utility that converts grayscale images into terrain brushes
in Quake .map format.  This tutorial shows how to make a map from a terrain
image made in Paint Shop Pro but it should be easily adapted to other paint
programs. This tutorial shows how to save the image in .tga format, but an
8 bit Raw File Format (.raw) image with no header will also work.</p>

<p>You can also try out the raw2map convertor using the sample files
&quot;17x17.raw&quot; and &quot;17x17.tga&quot;.  To do that just skip
ahead to <a href="#step4">Step 4</a>.</p>

<p>If you already know basically how to use raw2map, and just need more
information about it's options, skip ahead to the <a href="#options">Other
Options</a> section.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Paint the terrain as an 8 bit monochrome (256 shades of gray)
image.  Lighter pixels will be higher points on the terrain.<br>

<p><b>2.</b> Save the image as a .tga file.  If you are using Paint Shop
Pro, select the <b>Save <u>A</u>s</b> option from the <b><u>F</u>ile</b>
menu, then select &quot;Truevision Targa (*.tga)&quot; in the <b>Save As
<u>T</u>ype</b> list near the bottom left of the <b>Save <u>A</u>s</b>
dialog.<br>

<p><b>3.</b> Do not use compression. If you are using Paint Shop Pro, click
on the <b><u>O</u>ptions</b> button in the <b>Save <u>A</u>s</b> dialog
before saving the image. Select <b><u>8</u> bits</b> in the <b>Bit
Depth</b> section and <b><u>U</u>ncompressed</b> in the <b>Compression</b>
section. Then click on <b>OK</b> and then <b><u>S</u>ave.</b><br>

<p>This tutorial assumes that you have saved the image in the same folder
as the raw2map convertor, or that you are using one of the sample images
in that folder.</p>

<p><a name="step4"><b>4.</b> Open an MS-DOS Prompt or Command Prompt.</a>
For example, in Windows 95 or Windows 98 you can usually do this by opening
the <b>Start</b> menu, selecting <b>Programs</b> and then clicking on the
<b>MS-DOS Prompt</b> option. (Windows NT and 2000 have the &quot;Command
Prompt&quot; instead of the MS-DOS Prompt.)
<table border="1" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><tr><td bgcolor="#000000"><pre><font
color="#CCCCCC">C:\WINDOWS&gt;</font><font color="#FFFFFF">_ </font></pre>
</td></tr></table></p>

<p><b>5.</b> If the current drive letter in the MS-DOS prompt is not the
drive containing the image and the raw2map terrain convertor, type the
letter of the drive where the image and the convertor are found, followed
by a colon, and press &lt;Enter&gt;.

</td></tr></table></p>

<p><b>6.</b> Use the <b>CD</b> command to change to the directory (folder)
where the raw2map convertor and the image to be converted are.

</td></tr></table></p>

<p><b>7.</b> Type &quot;raw2map&quot; (don't type the quotes), followed by
a space and the name of the image you want to convert into a terrain map.
Then press &lt;Enter&gt; to run the convertor

<p><a name="options"><b>Other Options</b> - These other options</a>
are used by typing a hyphen (dash) and letter followed by a number value
or word. An &quot;[int]&quot; is a whole number, a &quot;[float]&quot;
is a number which can have a decimal part, and a &quot;[string]&quot;
is just a word like a filename.</p>

<pre>-w [int]    : image width in pixels (default = 0)</pre>

<p>Raw2map does not know the width and height of the image. This is used
to tell raw2map how wide the image is.  The height is figured out by
dividing the number of pixels in the image by the width.</p>

<p>If width is zero (0) - or if you don't specify a width - then
raw2map assumes that the image must be square and tries to use the
square root of the number of pixels as the width of the image.</p>

<pre>-o [string] : output filename</pre>

<p>By default, the .map file generated (the &quot;output&quot; file)
is named after the image file (the &quot;input&quot; file) except the
file type extension - such as &quot;.tga&quot; - is replaced with
&quot;.map&quot;.  This option allows you to choose a different name for
your output file.</p>

<pre>-h [float]  : horizontal scale (default = 128)</pre>

<p>This is the width between each pixel in Quake units.  The total width
of your generated terrain brushes will be the width of your image in
pixels, minus one (because there are only terrain brushes <i>between</i>
pixels) multiplied by this value.</p>

<pre>-v [float]  : vertical   scale (default = 4)</pre>

<p>This is the difference between each gray value in Quake units. For
example, the maximum height difference between any two corners of terrain
anywhere in the map is 255 times this value.</p>

<pre>-x [float]  : X offset (lattitude) (default = 0)</pre>

<p>The lower south-west corner of the terrain is placed at the center of
the map by default.  Use this option to move it East (positive value)
or West (negative value.)</p>

<pre>-y [float]  : Y offset (longitude) (default = 0)</pre>

<p>The lower south-west corner of the terrain is placed at the center of
the map by default.  Use this option to move it North (positive value)
or South (negative value.)</p>

<pre>-z [float]  : Z offset (altitude)  (default = 0)</pre>

<p>The lower south-west corner of the terrain is placed at the center of
the map by default.  Use this option to move it Up (positive value)
or Down (negative value.)</p>

<pre>-f [float]  : height of brush bottoms</pre>

<p>By default, the bottom of the terrain brushes generated by raw2map are
a little bit below the lowest possible point on the terrain (specifically,
one times the vertical scale below the height of a black pixel.)  Although
it is not often needed, you can use this option to specify a different
height for the bottoms of the terrain brushes.</p>

<p>Note: -v and -z restore default brush bottom height, so you must
specify the height of the brush bottoms with -f after -v and/or -z
if you don't want the default brush bottom height.</p>

<pre>-c [float]  : ceiling or sky height</pre>

<p>Raw2map generates walls and ceiling brushes so that you can easily use
the generated terrain maps.  By default the ceiling height is 64 plus the
maximum height of the terrain (the height of a white pixel.) You can make
the ceiling higher or lower with this option.</p>

<p>Note: -v and -z restore default ceiling height, so you must specify
the ceiling height with -c after -v and/or -z if you don't want the
default ceiling height.</p>

<pre>-t [float]  : wall thickness (default = 64)</pre>

<p>Raw2map generates walls and ceiling brushes so that you can easily use
the generated terrain maps.  By default the walls and ceiling are 64 units
thick. You can change the thickness of the walls and ceiling with this
option.</p>

<p>If you set the wall and ceiling thickness to zero (0) then raw2map will
not generate any wall or ceiling brushes.  It will also not generate any
hint brushes.  Hint brushes are specially textured brushes that can make
complex maps like these converted terrain maps easier to compile if you
use versions of the QBSP and VIS utilities that support hint brushes.</p>
