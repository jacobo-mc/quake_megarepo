USAGE: raw2map [options] <file> [more options and/or files]

OPTIONS:

	-w [int]    : image width in pixels (default = 0)
	              if width is 0, image is assumed to be square
	-o [string] : output filename (NOTE: affects only the next input file)
	              (default = input filename but with .map extension)
	-h [float]  : horizontal scale in Quake units per pixel (default = 128)
	-v [float]  : vertical   scale in Quake units per pixel (default = 4)
	-x [float]  : X offset (lattitude) in Quake units (default = 0)
	-y [float]  : Y offset (longitude) in Quake units (default = 0)
	-z [float]  : Z offset (altitude)  in Quake units (default = 0)
	-f [float]  : height of brush bottoms in Quake units
	              (default = Z offset - vertical scale)
	-c [float]  : ceiling or sky height in Quake units
	              (default = maximum terrain height + 64)
	-t [float]  : wall thickness in Quake units (default = 64)
	              (if this is 0, no wall or hint brushes will be created)
	              NOTE: -v and -z restore default floor and ceiling height

HISTORY:

10-4-00

First release

10-24-00

Changed "%f" to "%0.f" so there is no minimum number of decimal points written
in the fprintf statements in write_terrain_triangle() and write_terrain_quad().
This makes the output .map file much smaller.

3-17-01

Added walls, hint brushes, and am_detail grouping of terrain brushes.
Started adding support for BMP and TGA files, BMP is basically broken
8 bit uncompressed TGA files should work (but raw2map does not read the
width and height information from the TGA file.)

3-27-01

Changed printf format strings to output default precision

4-17-01

Added tutorial (index.html and images)
