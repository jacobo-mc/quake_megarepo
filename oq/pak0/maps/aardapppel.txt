Except q3dm6ish, these have been made using qoole, so may be messy.
In fact when compiling them I had to make very sure qbsp didn't
produce areas that allow you to get stuck, so you will need to do the
same.

Also, these maps were compiled with arghlite with the "-light 30"
(or thereabouts) switch. If you compile with standard id light,
the maps will be darker than the bsps on my page.

My advise: just replace the textures in the .bsp rather than recompiling.
You can do this with a utility such as adquedit very easily.

Finally, I hope you will show me the retextured version before you
release it, so that I can give comments.


q3dm6ish has been retextured using some of the textures from the free_wad.wad
and some from the Quake Retexturing Project (http://www.quake.cz/winclan/qe1/).
