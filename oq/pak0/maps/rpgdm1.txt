Description		: A small Quake deathmatch map designed for 1 vs 1
			  play, but also suitable for 3-4 player free-for-all
			  matches.  The map uses Speedy's Cr8 texture set, plus
			  a few complementary textures from various sources
			  (see below).

			  This map is a distant version of a Q1DM I made way
			  back in 1999, which was initially inspired by one of
			  the pieces of concept art from American McGee's
			  Alice.  Needless to say, the map has changed quite a
			  bit since then, and the original map is hardly
			  recognizable.  Even the tower that was inspired by
			  Alice is gone.

			  The map name comes from the phrase "Vote Vondur for
			  world domination!"  I'm not sure who coined it.  It
			  might have been ELEK.  Anyway, thanks to whoever came
			  up with it.
Additional credits	: id Software, Speedy, Lunaran, and scampie.
Thank yous		: God, Mom, Dan Smith, and aguiRe.  Particular thanks
			  to the testers: this map was made by all of you.
Testers			: cyBeAr, Aardappel, gibbie, inertia, BlackPope,
			  scampie, Blitz, Vondur.  I think CardO tested it too,
			  but I'm not sure.  Ah forget it--thanks to everyone
			  from #terrafusion and QMap/Func_msgboard; you
			  probably tested the map at some point.

* WHERE TO GET THIS LEVEL *

http://rpg.spawnpoint.org
Try a Google.com search for rpgsmse.zip if my site is down.


* COMPILATION *

I used Tyrlite to compile the map.  I used this commandline:

tyrlite.exe -nocount -extra rpgdm1

(-nocount just removes the progress indicator during the compile.)

The lights in the map make extensive use of the "wait" key.  
I also used the sunlight feature of Tyrlite.  But all of that is in the .map file,
 so all you should have to do is compile the map using Tyrlite.
