Notes
-----
This is the .map source file for the Quake map of the same name, released on
my website. It is provided in the hope that someone may find it useful. It
should be possible to build the finished map from this source using the
compile utils found on my website, but I make no guarantees. Textures are not
provided here; if needed, they can be extracted from the bsp file of the same
name.
