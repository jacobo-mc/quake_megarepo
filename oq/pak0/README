================================================================================

This module contains the source for all of the Open Quartz game data and the
related build system.  The build system will construct four pak files:
pak0.pak, pak1.pal, pak2.pak, and pak3.pak.


Building the pak files:

 1) Either compile or download pre-build versions of the Open Quartz utilities.

 2) Change the QUTILSDIR and UTILSDIR variables in "makefile" to point
    to your utilties.  You may skip this step if you have installed the "utils" 
    directory next to the "pak0" directory.

 3) Run "make" to start the build.  
    On Microsoft Windows, you may not have to install either
	MinGW (from http://www.mingw.org/) or cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/)
	to get make.

Installing/running the pak files:

 1) Obtain a Quake engine that you like.  
    We recommend using LorkHavoc's Dark Places engine, which we include
    with our "playable" version.
  
 2) Copy the four pak files (pak0.pak, pak1.pal, pak2.pak, and pak3.pak) into
    Quake's "id1" directory.

 3) If you are using Dark Places, you can also copy additional game 
    enhancements into the id1 directory:
	   gfx/*.tga
	   gfx/env/*.tga

 4) Run Quake.
