Map: egypt4.bsp (Hexen II registered version, in the data1/pak1.pak
pakfile.)

Of the two golems in the throne room (skill >= 2), the one closer to
the throne is not on ground.  Fixed by changing their origins from
"1888 368 184" to "1888 368 160" and "2240 416 184" to "2240 416 160"
in the entities.  See around lines 1679 and 1685 of the egypt4.ent
file included here.  (Fixed by Thomas Freundt.)
