Map: tower.bsp (Hexen II registered version, in the data1/pak1.pak
pakfile.)

The bronze golem in the elevator used to get stuck and die immediately.
Fixed by repositioning him from "-2296 -1048 -56" to "-2296 -1056 -80",
i.e. the entity that reads in the original like:

{
"angle" "0"
"health" "600"
"target" "golemdoor"
"origin" "-2296 -1048 -56"
"classname" "monster_golem_bronze"
}

... should look like :

{
"angle" "0"
"health" "600"
"target" "golemdoor"
"origin" "-2296 -1056 -80"
"classname" "monster_golem_bronze"
}

(See around line 861 of the tower.ent file included here.  Fix
by Thomas Freundt.)

You would still get a debug message:
		walkmonster in wall at: '-2296.0 -1056.0 -79.0'
... but at least he can break free now.
