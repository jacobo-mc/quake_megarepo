Map: tibet2.bsp (Hexen II Mission Pack: Portal of Praevus, in portals/pak3.pak
pakfile.)

In map tibet3 (False Temple) with hard or nightmare difficulty, objective #26
"Take the Jade Buddha to the offering place in the False Temple" isn't cleared
when Little Buddha is placed. This is because the trigger_objective entity
clearing objective #26 is not set for hard and higher difficulty, however the
entity which sets the objective itself back in tibet2 is missing the NOT_HARD
(0x4000) flag. This objective is meant for easy and medium difficulty settings
only, as is evidenced by the appearance of another trigger to clear obj. #26
later in tibet4, which also has the NOT_HARD flag set.

In short, the entity that reads in the original like:

{
"origin" "1136 -232 776"
"frags" "26"
"targetname" "t357"
"spawnflags" "32769"
"classname" "trigger_objective"
}

... should look like:

{
"origin" "1136 -232 776"
"frags" "26"
"targetname" "t357"
"spawnflags" "49153"
"classname" "trigger_objective"
}
