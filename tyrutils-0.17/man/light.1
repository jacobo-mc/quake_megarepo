.SH NAME
light \- Caclulate lightmap data for a Quake BSP file

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlight\fP [OPTION]... BSPFILE

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlight\fP reads a Quake .bsp file and calculates light and shadow
information based on the entity definitions contained in the .bsp.  The .bsp
file is updated with the new light data upon completion, overwriting any
existing lighting data.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-threads n\fP"
Set number of threads explicitly. By default light will attempt to detect the
number of CPUs/cores available.
.IP "\fB\-extra\fP"
Calculate extra samples (2x2) and average the results for smoother shadows.
.IP "\fB\-extra4\fP"
Calculate even more samples (4x4) and average the results for smoother
shadows.
.IP "\fB\-light n\fP"
Set a global minimum light level for style 0 (default)
lightmaps. Overrides default light level set in worldspawn.
.IP "\fB\-addmin\fP"
Changes the behaviour of \fIminlight\fP.  Instead of increasing low
light levels to the global minimum, add the global minimum light level
to all style 0 lightmaps.  This may help reducing the sometimes
uniform minlight effect.
.IP "\fB\-dist n\fP"
Scales the fade distance of all lights by a factor of n.  If n > 1 lights fade
more quickly with distance and if n < 1, lights fade more slowly with distance
and light reaches further.
.IP "\fB\-range n\fP"
Scales the brightness range of all lights without affecting their fade
discance.  Values of n > 0.5 makes lights brighter and n < 0.5 makes lights
less bright.  The same effect can be achieved on individual lights by
adjusting both the "light" and "wait" attributes.
.IP "\fB\-gate n\fP"
Set a minimum light level, below which can be considered zero brightness.
This can dramatically speed up processing when there are large numbers of
lights with inverse or inverse square falloff. In most cases, values less than
1.0 will cause no discernable visual differences.  Default 0.001.
.IP "\fB\-soft [n]\fP"
Perform post-processing on the lightmap which averages adjacent samples to
smooth shadow edges.  If n is specified, the algorithm will take 'n' samples
on each side of the sample point and replace the original value with the
average. e.g. a value of 1 results in averaging a 3x3 square centred on the
original sample. 2 implies a 5x5 square and so on.  If \-soft is specified, but
n is omitted, a value will be the level of oversampling requested. If no
oversampling, then the implied value is 1. \-extra implies a value of 2 and
\-extra4 implies 3.  Default 0 (off).
.IP "\fB\-anglescale\fP | \fB\-anglesense\fP"
Set the scaling of sunlight brightness due to the angle of incidence with a
surface (more detailed explanation in the "_anglescale" key below).
.IP "\fB\-lit\fP"
Force generation of a .lit file, even if your map does not have any coloured
lights. By default, light will automatically generate the .lit file when
needed.
.IP "\fB\-litonly\fP"
Force generation of a lit file that will be compatible with the current bsp
file without modification.  That is, the lit file will be generated with
lightmap offsets that exactly match the lighting that is already present in
the bsp.  You usually do NOT want this option except in the circumstance that
you want to make a coloured light add-on for an existing BSP but you have the
restriction that the original bsp file must not be modified in any way.

.SH "MODEL ENTITY KEYS"

.SS "Worldspawn Keys"

.PP
The following keys can be added to the \fIworldspawn\fP entity:

.IP "\fB""light"" ""n""\fP"
Set a global minimum light level of "n" across the whole map.  This is an easy
way to eliminate completely dark areas of the level, however you may lose some
contrast as a result, so use with care. Default 0.

.IP "\fB""_sunlight"" ""n""\fP"
Set the brightness of the sunlight coming from an unseen sun in the sky.  Sky
brushes (or more accurately bsp leafs with sky contents) will emit sunlight at
an angle specified by the "_sun_mangle" key.  Default 0.

.IP "\fB""_sun_mangle"" ""x y z""\fP"
Specifies the direction of sunlight using yaw(x), pitch(y) and roll(z) in
degrees. Yaw specifies the angle around the Z-axis from 0 to 359 degrees and
pitch specifies the angle from 90 (straight up) to -90 (straight down). Roll
has no effect, so use any value (e.g. 0).  Default is straight down ("0 -90
0").

.IP "\fB""_sunlight_color"" ""r g b""\fP"
Specify red(r), green(g) and blue(b) components for the colour of the
sunlight. RGB component values are between 0 and 255. Default is white light
("255 255 255").

.SS "Model Entity Keys"

.PP
The following keys can be used on any entity with a brush model:

.IP "\fB""_minlight"" ""n""\fP"
Set the minimum light level for any surface of the brush model.  Default 0.

.IP "\fB""_mincolor"" ""r g b""\fP"
Specify red(r), green(g) and blue(b) components for the colour of the
minlight. RGB component values are between 0 and 255. Default is white light
("255 255 255").

.IP "\fB""_shadow"" ""n""\fP"
If n is 1, this model will cast shadows on other models and itself
(i.e. "_shadow" implies "_shadowself").  Note that this doesn't magically give
Quake dynamic lighting powers, so the shadows will not move if the model
moves. Default 0.

.IP "\fB""_shadowself"" ""n""\fP"
If n is 1, this model will cast shadows on itself if one part of the model
blocks the light from another model surface. This can be a better compromise
for moving models than full shadowing.  Default 0.

.SH "LIGHT ENTITY KEYS"

.PP
Light entity keys can be used in any entity with a classname starting
with the first five letters "light". E.g. "light", "light_globe",
"light_flame_small_yellow", etc.

.IP "\fB""light"" ""n""\fP"
Set the light intensity. Negative values are also allowed and will cause the
entity to subtract light cast by other entities. Default 300.

.IP "\fB""wait"" ""n""\fP"
Scale the fade distance of the light by "n". Values of n > 1 make the light
fade more quickly with distance, and values < 1 make the light fade more
slowly (and thus reach further). Default 1.

.IP "\fB""delay"" ""n""\fP"
Select an attenuation formaula for the light:
.nf
  0 => Linear attenuation (default)
  1 => 1/x attenuation
  2 => 1/(x^2) attenuation
  3 => No attenuation (same brightness at any distance)
  4 => "local minlight" - No attenuation and like minlight,
       it won't raise the lighting above it's light value.
       Unlike minlight, it will only affect surfaces within
       line of sight of the entity.
  5 => 1/(x^2) attenuation, but slightly more attenuated and
       without the extra bright effect that "delay 2" has
       near the source.
.fi

.IP "\fB""_color"" ""r g b""\fP"
Specify red(r), green(g) and blue(b) components for the colour of the
light. RGB component values are between 0 and 255. Default is white light
("255 255 255").

.IP "\fB""target"" ""name""\fP"
Turns the light into a spotlight, with the direction of light being towards
another entity with it's "targetname" key set to "name".

.IP "\fB""mangle"" ""x y z""\fP"
Turns the light into a spotlight and specifies the direction of light using
yaw(x), pitch(y) and roll(z) in degrees. Yaw specifies the angle around the
Z-axis from 0 to 359 degrees and pitch specifies the angle from 90 (straight
up) to -90 (straight down). Roll has no effect, so use any value (e.g. 0).
Often easier than the "target" method.

.IP "\fB""angle"" ""n""\fP"
Specifies the angle in degrees for a spotlight cone. Default 40.

.IP "\fB""_softangle"" ""n""\fP"
Specifies the angle in degrees for an inner spotlight cone (must be less than
the "angle" cone. Creates a softer transition between the full brightness of
the inner cone to the edge of the outer cone.  Default 0 (disabled).

.IP "\fB""targetname"" ""name""\fP"
Turns the light into a switchable light, toggled by another entity targeting
it's name.

.IP "\fB""style"" ""n""\fP"
Set the animated light style. Default 0.

.IP "\fB""_anglescale"" ""n""\fP | \fB""_anglesense"" ""n""\fP"
Sets a scaling factor for how much influence the angle of incidence of light
on a surface has on the brightness of the surface. \fIn\fP must be between 0.0
and 1.0. Smaller values mean less attenuation, with zero meaning that angle of
incidence has no effect at all on the brightness. Default 0.5.
