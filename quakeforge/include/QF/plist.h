	  * QFString: the  point to the actual string. The string continues

	  * QFBinary: pointer to fixed-size DARRAY_TYPE(byte) (so size isn't
		lost)

		indivisual objects. The individual objects continue to be owned
		by the array object.
	  * QFDictionary: pointer to the hashtab_t hash table used for the
		dictionary object. The hash table continues to be owned by the
		dictionary object.

	\param field	Pointer to this field item.
	\param item		The property list item being parsed into the field.
	\param data		Pointer to the field in the structure being parsed.
	\param messages	An array object the parser can use to store any
					error messages. Messages should be strings, but no
					checking is done: it is up to the top-level caller to
					parse out the messages.
