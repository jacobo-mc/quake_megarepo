/** Control the positioning of a view within its parent. The directions are
	the standard compass rose (north, east, south, west in clockwise order)
	with north at the top.

	The origin of the view is taken to be the corresponding point on the edge
	of the view (eg, southeast is bottom right), or the view's center for
	center gravity. When the relative coordinates of the view are (0,0), the
	view's origin is placed on the parent view's gravity point using the view's
	gravity (\em not the parent view's gravity). That is, the parent view's
	gravity has no effect on the view's position within the parent view.

	The gravity also affects the direction the view moves as the relative
	coordinates of the view change.

	No checking is done to ensure the view stays within the parent, or that the
	view is smaller than the parent. This is by design. It is up to the drawing
	callbacks to do any necessary clipping.
