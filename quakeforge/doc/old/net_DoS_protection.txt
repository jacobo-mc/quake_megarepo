SV_NETDOSPROTECT 0/1 
Used to turn on/off Denial Of Service protections. Makes it more 
difficult to use quakeworld servers to conduct DoS attacks against 
other sites.

NETDOSVALUES
Tells server how many of specified kind of requests (per IP addr) 
are allowed during time defined with NETDOSEXPIRE.
Possible request types:
<FLOOD_PING> <FLOOD_LOG> <FLOOD_CONNECT> <FLOOD_STATUS> <FLOOD_RCON> <FLOOD_BAN>

NETDOSEXPIRE
Tells server how much time must pass before request counter expires
and gets set to zero.



NETDOSVALUES <FLOOD_PING> <FLOOD_LOG> <FLOOD_CONNECT> <FLOOD_STATUS> <FLOOD_RCON> <FLOOD_BAN>
NETDOSEXPIRE <FLOOD_PING> <FLOOD_LOG> <FLOOD_CONNECT> <FLOOD_STATUS> <FLOOD_RCON> <FLOOD_BAN>

defaults are:

NETDOSVALUES 12 1 3 1 1 1 1
NETDOSEXPIRE 1  1 2 0.9 1 5

meaning :
maximum of 12 PINGS are allowed in 1 second
maximum of 1 LOG request / second
maximum of 2 connect requests / 3 seconds
maximum of 1 status request / 0.9 seconds
maximum of 1 rcon command / 1 second
maximum of 1 request from banned IP / 5 second

Examples
if server receives 15 ping requests under 1 second, it will allow 12 requests
and drop 3 without response.

Other commands:

sv_allow_log
Allow/disallow remote LOG requests

sv_allow_status
Allow/disallow remote status requests

sv_allow_ping 
Allow/disallow remote pings
