\page cshift_cvars cshift control

New cvars:
\li cl_cshift_bonus: Set to 0 to disable bonus flashes.
\li cl_cshift_contents: Set to 0 to disable content blends.
\li cl_cshift_damage: Set to 0 to disable damage blends.
\li cl_cshift_powerup: Set to 0 to disable powerup (quad, pent, etc) blends.

All of these cvars work for both GL and software, and all of them check
the value of the "cshifts" serverinfo. cshifts is a bit field, with the
following bits defined:

\li bonus: 1
\li contents: 2
\li damage: 4
\li powerup: 8

An admin can force any of these to be respected by choosing the numbers of
the cshifts to be enforced, and adding them up.

examples:
\verbatim
serverinfo cshifts 15
\endverbatim
turns them all on.

\verbatim
serverinfo cshifts 10
\endverbatim
turns on powerup and contents shifts.
