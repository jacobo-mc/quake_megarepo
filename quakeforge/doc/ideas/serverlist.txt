Ideas for console based server list.

2 lists, favorates and all (possably a seperate filtered all list)
favorates listed in [nq|qw]servers.txt
master servers listed in [nq|qw]masters.txt
all is all servers reported by masters

filter all by ping and game, limit ping to 600 (double what I consider playable)optional filter of min players on server

Possable Commands
slist refresh // refreshes the details of the currently listed servers
slist update // if favorates list it does a refresh 
	     // otherwise it queries the master servers
	     // either case auto request details
slist favorates|all|filtered // switches to the appropriate list favorates being
			     // the default
slist list // shows what list is being used
slist // lists servers from active list
slist # // lists details of server no. # from list
slist connect [#] // connects to server in list, not including a # makes qf
		  // connect to the last server whos details were displayed
slist add // adds current server to favorates list (auto save)
slist del # // remove server no. # from the favorates list (auto save)
slist insert # // insert current server into position no # in the favorates list
