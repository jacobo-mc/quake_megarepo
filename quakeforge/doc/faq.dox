\section gfx_wad What does "W_LoadWadFile: unable to load gfx.wad" mean?
The most common cause of this error is \QF is unable to find
pak0.pak. \QF looks for pak0.pak in both the $fs_userpath/id1 and
$fs_sharepath/id1 directories. In Windows, both fs_userpath and fs_sharepath
default to "." (ie, the current directory: the same as id's Quake clients). In
Linux (and other UNIX like operating systems), fs_userpath defaults to
~/.quakeforge and fs_sharepath defaults to $prefix/share/games/quakeforge
(distribution packages might alter the exact path).

See \ref filesystem for more details.

\section pak0_pak Where can I get pak0.pak?
See \ref game_data

\section game_data Why doesn't \QF come with the game data?
While \QF itself (and the Quake source code in general) is Free
Software, the game itself is not free. You need to either purchase it from <a
href="http://www.idsoftware.com/store/index.php?view=quake">id Software</a> or
you can use <a href="http://openquartz.sourceforge.net/">OpenQuartz</a>, a
project developing GPL-compatible game data for Quake.

\section git_compile_error Checking out git and running ./bootstrap creates a configure that syntax errors when I run it! What's wrong?
Unlike downloading and compiling a release, when you checkout from git, you
must have all the dependencies of \QF already installed as when
configure is being created autotools sources m4 files... If the files do not
exist, you get the errors you have seen. Try installing packages which contain
the libraries that caused the syntax error, including the -dev versions, then
recreate configure using bootstrap and try again.

\section no_music Why doesn't \QF play the background music even though I have the CD in the drive?
By default, \QF no longer uses the CD drive to play music. Instead, \QF now
looks for a \ref tracklist to map Quake's cd tracks to sound files. If you
wish to continue using the CD instead, you may set the \c cd_plugin cvar to
the value appropriate for your system:
<dl>
	<dt><code>file</code></dt>	<dd>The default CD plugin. Uses sound files
									for the BGM.</dd>
	<dt><code>linux</code></dt>	<dd>Use this plugin on a Linux system.</dd>
	<dt><code>sdl</code></dt>	<dd>This plugin can be used on most
									systems.</dd>
<!--	<dt><code>sgi</code></dt>	<dd>Use this plugin on SGI systems.</dd>-->
	<dt><code>win</code></dt>	<dd>Use this plugin on Windows
									systems.</dd>
	<dt><code>xmms</code></dt>	<dd>The predecessor to the \c file plugin.
									Not always available, and expects xmms
									to be available (but not necessarily
									running) on the system. Useful if you
									absolutely must have MP3 support.</dd>
</dl>

\section no_mp3 Why doesn't \QF support MP3s?
Because they are not free. MP3 support is a patent minefield, and we really
don't want to wind up with lawyers at ten paces, especially since we'd be
unarmed with no armor, and they have rocket launchers and quad-damage.

\section faq_cvar_rom How do I set a read-only cvar (eg, snd_rate)?
Read-only cvars can be set by creating them before the engine does. See
\ref cvar_rom for details.
