.SH NAME
pak \- The QuakeForge Packfile Tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pak
<\fBcommand\fP> [\fBoptions\fP] \fIARCHIVE\fP \fIFILE\fP...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpak\fP is a utility for managing pack (*.pak) archives. The format used is
compatible with Quake and Quake II. Pak archives are a convenient way to store
groups of related files. Some engines allow pak archives to be compressed
internally.
.SH COMMANDS
\fBpak\fP accepts the following arguments as a command. Only one command may be
used at a time.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-create
Create an archive. Overwrites any contents the archive may have had.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-test
Test an archive for valid formatting.
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-extract
Extract an archive. Overwrites any files in the current directory with the same
names as those inside the archive.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show the version of pak.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBpak\fP takes the following arguments as options.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-file ARCHIVE
Use ARCHIVE as the archive filename, instead of the first non-option argument.
This option is provided for compatibility with older versions of \fBpak\fP.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-pad
Can be useful when creating an archive. File space is padded to a 4\-byte
boundary, assisting in the speed of loading files from the archive. The file
data itself is not changed.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Inhibit some of pak's normal output.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Display more output than usual.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
\fBpak\fP returns a zero exit status when it has completed a command
successfully (without error). Otherwise, it returns a non-zero exit status.
.SH BUGS
.PP
The program does not currently handle compression or decompression. This
is planned for a future version.
.PP
The program does not currently handle extraction of individual files inside an
archive. This is planned for a future version.
.PP
The program cannot modify an archive once it has been created.
.SH AUTHORS
