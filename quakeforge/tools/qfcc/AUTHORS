The original "qcc" program was written by Id Software, Inc.
This version was created by Jeff Teunissen <deek@dusknet.dhs.org> and is
maintained by The QuakeForge Project <quakeforge-devel@lists.quakeforge.net>

Please do not contact Id Software for technical support on this program -- they
do not care about it any more. :)
