		The function parameters form the root scope for the function. Its
		defspace is separate from the locals defspace so that it can be moved
		to the beginning of locals space for v6 progs, and too the end (just
		above the stack pointer on entry to the function) for Ruamoko progs.

		The locals scope is a direct child of the parameters scope, and any
		sub-scope symbol tables are not directly accessible, but all defs
		other than function call arugments created in the function's local
		data space are recorded in the root local scope symbol table's
		defspace.

		The arguments defspace is not used for v6 progs. It is used as a
		highwater allocator for the arguments to all calls made by the
		funciton, with the arguments to separate functions overlapping each
		other.

		Afther the function has been emitted, locals, arguments and possibly
		parameters will be merged into the one defspace.
