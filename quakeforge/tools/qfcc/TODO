o = todo
X = done
? = maybe but not likely
M = more testing
I = in progress
W = waiting on other work

X	fix object files
X	fix enums in switch statements (use tables (treat as int), check missing)
M	arrays in structures
M	unnamed function parameters for prototypes/typdefs etc.
I	optimizations (esp CSE)
I	fix used/uninitialized warnings
o	id id;
M	vec = [x, y, z]; expressions (nice feature in fteqcc)
M	finish -Fifstring
o	isset() intrinsic for more consistent string handling.
o	arrays in entities
o	optional arguments for functions (alternative to overloading)
	vector(vector fwd, optional vector up) vectoangles = #51;
o	rewrite type system to be const-correct (hard!)
?	try to reduce memory consumption
??	embedded nul characters in strings (why?)
