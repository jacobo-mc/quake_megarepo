qf cvs - (Bill Currie) bring into QF using quakeio functions, creating an
         image_t type for the line point drawing, ditching the raw and bmp
         formats in favor of pcx (for now), and renaming to bsp2img. I'll be
         working on getopt, bspfile and other image formats in the future as
         well as generally cleaning up the code.
