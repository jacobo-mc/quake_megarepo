Explanation of options:
-----------------------

scaledown - amount by which the bsp map coordinates are scaled down
            by when generating the bitmap. The default of 1/4 size
            gives a decent compromise between detail and a not-too-
            overly large resulting image. Value must be less than 1.

z_scaling - generate isometric-type (well, sorta) 3d look by taking
            the Z-coordinate to shift the point when plotting the
            bitmap. See <direction> for control of direction of
            shift. The number specified is the maximum number of pixels
            by which the shift will be done. If equal to 0 (default),
            the map will be 'flat'

padding - margin to place around the image, in pixels.
          Default is 16.

direction - direction in which shifting will be done for plotting of
            Z-axis. Default direction is 1 (up and to the right),
            which for a cube will give something like:

               +-----+
              /|    /|
             / |   / |
            +--|--+  |
            |  +-----+
            | /   | /
            |/    |/
            +-----+

camera axis - axis along which the camera will sit. Valid choices

flatness - extraneous edges are removed by taking the dot product of
           the unit vector normals of the faces which use that edge. If
           the dot product is less than this threshold, then the line
           will be plotted.
           A dot product of 1.0 means the two faces are in the
           same plane, and hence the edge should be dropped. Anything
           less than the threshold will be drawn. A bit of leeway is
           allowed with a 0.90 threshold for rounding errors and map
           design imperfections (ie. walls not EXACTLY parallel).

area/line minimums - if a given edge is smaller than the line minimum
                      or a given face is smaller than the area minimum,
                     the line(s) won't be drawn. This can be used to 
                     get rid of smaller details from cluttering up the
                     final output. You may have to play around with the
                     numbers to fine tune the output.

raw data - if specified, output will be the raw bitmap data, not a BMP.

Notes:
------

* NO error checking is done on the bsp file as of this moment. Use at your
  own risk, if you plan on (or accidentally) specifiy a non-bsp file, or use
  on a buggy (ie. improperly referenced faces/edges/etc.) bsp file.

* Edge removal is still a big buggy... occasionally some edges which should
  be kept are removed anyways, or vice versa!
