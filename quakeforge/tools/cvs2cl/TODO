Oh Most High and Puissant Emacs, pleased to be in -*- outline -*- mode!

This is my list of pending changes.  I really, really will get to
these soon.  

Each entry is marked with an asterisk at the beginning of the line.
Type C-c C-t to collapse all entries, C-c C-a to show them.

* Cumulative behavior?
Would be great if cvs2cl could read an existing ChangeLog and then
get only the amount of information required to bring it up to date.
I.e., it would find the front date in the ChangeLog and use that in a
"cvs log -d" invocation.  Heh.  Easy to do.  So do it.

* Modify CVS to expand usernames based on CVSROOT/users
So that the -U option isn't needed.
