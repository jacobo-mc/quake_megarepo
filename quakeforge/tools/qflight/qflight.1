.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBqflight\fP accepts the following arguments as a command. Only one command may be
used at a time.

.B \-h, \-\-help

.SH OPTIONS

By default qflight takes one sample from each light point, running with "-extra" enabled takes four samples and averages them. 
This gives smoother lighting/shadows but takes four times as long.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-distance (n)
Scales the fade distance of ALL lights. n>1 fades faster, n<1 fades slower.  
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-range (n)
Scales the brightness range of ALL lights without affecting their fade distance.
n>.5 makes them brighter, n<.5 makes them darker.
