.SH NAME
bsputil \- utiltiy for working with Quake BSP files

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbsputil\fP [OPTION]... BSPFILE

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbsputil is a small utility for basic manipulation of Quake BSP files.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB--extract-textures\fP"
Extract the texture data from \fIBSPFILE\fP and create a Quake WAD
file.  The output filename is generated from \fIBSPFILE\fP by
stripping the .bsp extension and adding the .wad extension.
.IP "\fB--extract-entities\fP"
Extract the entity data from \fIBSPFILE\fP and create a plain
text .ent file.  The output filename is generated from \fIBSPFILE\fP
by stripping the .bsp extension and adding the .ent extension.
.IP "\fB--check\fP"
Load \fIBSPFILE\fP into memory and run a set of tests to check that
all internal data structures are self-consistent.  Currently the tests
are very basic and not all warnings will result in errors from all
versions of the Quake engine.  This option is not targeted at level
designers, but is intended to assist with development of the
\fBqbsp\fP tool and check that a "clean" bsp file is generated.
