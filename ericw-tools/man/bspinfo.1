.TH BSPINFO 1 "TYR_VERSION" TYRUTILS

.SH NAME
bspinfo \- print basic information about a Quake BSP file

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbspinfo\fP BSPFILE

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbspinfo\fP will print a very basic summary of the internal data in
\fIBSPFILE\fP.  The BSP version number is printed, followed by one
line for each of the data types inside, giving the count and data size
in bytes of each data type.

If the filename \fIBSPFILE\fP does not have a .bsp extension,
\fBbsputil\fP will look for a .bsp file by stripping the file
extension from BSPFILE (if any) and appending ".bsp".
