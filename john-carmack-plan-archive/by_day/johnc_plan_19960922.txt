I had a good time at the New York event -- it was fun to meet a lot of the web and clan guys, and there was some good fierce deathmatch action.

The QuakeWorld beta has revved a couple more times. When things work right, its great, but it seems like it only works right on about half the windows machines we try it on.

We have at least a week of beating on it before a public release.
