I hope everyone is enjoying the quake 2 test.

Its always hard to release a version of a product that you know isn't in its final form. There are plenty of things that are getting better every single day, but we need to chop it off at some point to let everyone test it out.

We will do another demo after we finish the full retail product, so if you don't like looking at preproduction stuff, wait for that one.

Still, I am pretty happy with the test. I think Quake 2 is definately the most cohesive game we have ever done.

Don't worry - just because the test doesn't have multiplayer in it, it doesn't mean that we haven't been thinking about it. Many features in the quake 2 architecture are going to enable a whole new level of net play. It will take a few months after the full release for all the potential to start showing through, but just you wait!

The biggest changes to Quake 2 are internal. Anyone doing modification work on Quake is going to be ecstatic when they get to work with quake2. The game dll source code and all the utilities (including the OpenGl map editor) will be released shortly after the game hits store shelves.
