Ok, the current OpenGL code no longer scales the status bar and console. You can stop complaining now. The next release will be the consolidated rendering code for quakeworld. I'm not sure when I will be able to make a standalone version.

The consolidated quake will also be available on NT-alpha as well as x86. If you have a powerstorm-T card, glquake works pretty good. Glint and oxygen cards don't work well enough, but the normal quake software version should work fine. We may get a little bit of asm code written for the software version.
