We got 70 people on a base100 server, and it died after it wedged at 100% utilization for a while. Tomorrow we will find exactly what overflowed, and do some profiling.

Base100 is really only good for 50 or so players without overcrowding, but we have another map being built that should hold 100 people reasonably well.

I will look into which will be the easier path to more server performance: scalar optimization of whatever is critical now, or splitting it off into some more threads to run on multiple processors. Neither one is trivial.

My goal is to be able to host stable 100 player games in a single map.

I just added a "players" command that will dump the total number of players in the game, and as many frags/names as it can fit in a packet (around 50, I think).
