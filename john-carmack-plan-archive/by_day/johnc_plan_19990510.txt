A good day of work. I just finished a long test game with all three architectures, and everything looks solid.

As far as I can tell, these are ready to go after making installers and such, but everyone else has an oportunity to find bugs while I sleep...

We won't hold up for minor gameplay issues, but if anyone turns up a repeatable crasher I will rebuild everything.

Barring problems, we should start rolling the releases out tonight.

* fixed crash case on fallback from an unsupported fullscreen
* fixed overrun with very fast system connecting to a very lagged server
* fixed bad Z_Free on sounds not found
* fixed autoswitch with sync clients
* fixed losing console field on positive histories
* fixed demo recording and playback with new net code
* handle signed bit fields in msg code
* fixed playerstate event bit loss on encoding
* fixed "bad clientnum on player entity"
* reenabled corpses sinking into ground
