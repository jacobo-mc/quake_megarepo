Anna Kang left Id a couple weeks ago to found her own company - Fountainhead Entertainment.

It wasn't generally discussed during her time at Id, but we had been going out when she joined the company, and we were engaged earlier this year. We are getting married next month, and honeymooning in Hawaii. At her thoughtful suggestion, we are shipping a workstation out with us, so I don't fall into some programming-deprivation state. How great is that? :)

Now that Q3A has shipped, the official winner of her Id Software figurine chess set contest is Rowan Crawford for his prose and art.

An honorable mention goes to Reine Hogberg and Peder Hardings for their Q3A Blair Witch Project. They will receive silver Q3A medallions.
