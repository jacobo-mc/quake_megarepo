Ferrari update.

Unless someone can come up with a compelling objection, I think we have an end plan now:

Intergraph is currently holding a very cool clan tournement that will have the finals at E3. The ClanRing guys are managing the tournement, and intergraph is picking up the bill. It's going to be great, with clan banners and projection screens. They allready have a pretty good prize lineup of cash and systems.

The current proposal is to expand the event to include one on one deathmatches in addition to the clan fights. The grand prize will be my 328. I don't think it would go over too well to have a ferrari as clan property :-)

Intergraph is willing to pay for travel and accomadations for twelve to sixteen contestants.

We still need to figure out how to select the finalists. The idea is that we can tell all the press types about the event now, and have a last-minute runnoff of some sort the month before E3. That way even people who aren't usually active on the internet can find out about it through a magazine and take a shot at it.
