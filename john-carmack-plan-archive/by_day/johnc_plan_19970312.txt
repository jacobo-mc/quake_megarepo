Hi,

the two above statements contradict each other. How many ferraries 
would you have been able to buy if the sales of your games were limited 
to U.S. only ? It seems to me that you don't value your oversea 
customers at all and invite them to pirate future ID software products.

I paid for Doom I, Doom II and Quake and since this press release I am 
not really sure if I should spend any more money on ID software.

There are other companies that might value their customers for real.

AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!!! I have gotten a few of these "you suck cuz I can't win your car" type of messages.

I'm giving the car away over the objections of my lawyer and my girlfriend just because I think it will be a cool and memorable thing to do. I want it to be as fair as possible, but I just don't have the time to spare to try and manage it myself. In any case, it wouldn't be fair to everyone no matter what we did. Sure, it would be great if we could fly the 10,000 interested people to a football stadium and have thousands of simultanious double ellimination bouts, but it just isn't going to happen.

I pushed against the "us citizans" clause, asking if it would be reasonable to bring a couple people from europe or austrailia, or even just allow some people that covered their own expenses, but aparently we would have to deal with the local laws in each country that an entrant comes from, which just wouldn't be reasonable for us. Even dealing with canada (as we have found out recently with Christian) can be a big pain in the ass.

Its just a fact of life that locality is an issue. We can't treat the entire world the same. Go convince another company that "might value their customers for real" to give you a ferrari.
