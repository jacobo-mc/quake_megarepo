Over the weekend, I ported Quake to open-gl / win32. It is a complete port with all features supported. Its not really practical right now on most consumer level equipment, but it runs ok on my intergraph glz-13t. It will work on the 3dlabs cards with their next driver release, but it really isn't very optimized yet, so don't expect anything really fast.

If you have high end hardware (intergraph realizm or dec powerstorm), it is pretty cool.

It is interesting to look at quake with hires 24 bit trilinear texture mapping. Sometimes you just don't even notice anything is different, but sometimes you can just stare at a scene for quite a while apreciating it.

Throwing bits and pixels at a static design certainly doesn't hurt, but it really doesn't bring it to a new level. I think I know where the next level is, but I'm just at the very beginning of the work on the next game architecture.

We have three mostly-done things to release: winquake, glquake, and quakeworld. No, I don't know when any of them are actually going to be released. Sorry.

QuakeWorld will actually download a new level for you now if you want to wait for it. Little models and sounds are a lot more practical to customize a server with, though.

Today I got cornered by the three level designers and an artist and they jumped all over me for working on new research instead of polishing the quake 2 tools. I guess the rest of my week is spoken for...
