Id Software went to the drag strip today.

The 100 degree heat was pretty opressive, and my NOS regulator wasn't working, but a good time was had by all.

I made six runs in the 126 to 133 mph range and didn't even burn a spark plug, which is a nice change from a couple road track events I have been to.

Best times for everyone:

[code]
Bob Norwood's PCA race car: 10.9 / 133 mph (slicks)
My turbo testarossa         12.1 / 132
Adrian's viper              13.5 / 105
Todd's 'vette               13.9 / 101
Tim's porsche               14.3 / 96
Bear's supra:               14.4 / 96
Cash's M3                   15.2 / 94

My TR is never going to be a good drag car (>4000 lbs!), but when we go back on a cool day this fall and I get my NOS running, it should be good for over 140 in the quarter. 50 mph to 200 mph is it's real sweet spot.

I think Bear is heading for the chip dealer so he can get ahead of Tim :)
