The second generation QuakeWorld is out and live now.

We will probably release a couple bug fix versions over the next week or so as problems are reported.

Overall, I'm pleased with the results - I think I have delivered very solid improvements in game play. I certainly learned a lot along the way. If you have anything resembling a decent connection, you should be able to play a good game. A server with a 400+ ms ping and 10% packet loss is still not going to play all that great, but you should just avoid those.

The packet size is about as small as it is going to get for the general cases. Any more shrinkage will have to be game-specific compression, like the specialized nail update.

I can make doors and plats move smoothly, but it will take a good chunk more development. This will probably be done for quake 2.

I have it all set up to clip movement against other players during prediction, but I probably need a day or two to finish it. I'm not confidant that I'll get to that anytime soon, though.

I really want to get client side demo recording and more spectator mode options (see through player's eyes, chase cam, etc), but I just don't have the time right now.

The next major upgrade will be a quakeworld that can run in software and OpenGL modes. A verite module will come later.

This combination (QW networking and switchable rendering) will be the base that we move all of our Quake 2 work over to.
