Just got back from the Q2 wrap party in vegas that Activision threw for us.

Having a reasonable grounding in statistics and probability and no belief in luck, fate, karma, or god(s), the only casino game that interests me is blackjack.

Playing blackjack properly is a test of personal discipline. It takes a small amount of skill to know the right plays and count the cards, but the hard part is making yourself consistently behave like a robot, rather than succumbing to your "gut instincts".

I play a basic high/low count, but I scale my bets widely - up to 20 to 1 in some cases. Its not like I'm trying to make a living at it, so the chance of getting kicked out doesn't bother me too much.

I won $20,000 at the tables, which I am donating to the Free Software Foundation. I have been meaning to do something for the FSF for a long time. Quake was deployed on a dos port of FSF software, and both DOOM and Quake were developed on NEXTSTEP, which uses many FSF based tools. I don't subscribe to all the FSF dogma, but I have clearly benefited from their efforts.
