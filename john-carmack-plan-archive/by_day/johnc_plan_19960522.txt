is near Z clipping of alias models a bad idea?
allow multiple packfiles to override one another
better ideal pitch on slopes
mouse pitch/strafe combo
look at redbook audio
restart shouldn't drop console.
check for reloading the same level.
noambient flag for low memory systems
check zone memory allocation for bindings
differentiate reconnect
allow up/down in water
swimming frames
print bindings option
more edge friction?
reletive volumes for each ambient sound
explicit bindings for key up / key down?
teamplay totals
level name in solo scoreboard
