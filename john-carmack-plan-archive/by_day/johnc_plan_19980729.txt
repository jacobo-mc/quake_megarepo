My F50 took some twin turbo vitamins.

Rear wheel numbers: 602 HP @ 8200 rpm 418 ft-lb @ 7200 rpm

This is very low boost, but I got the 50% power increase I was looking for, and hopefully it won't be making any contributions to my piston graveyard.

There will be an article in Turbo magazine about it, and several other car magazines want to test it out. They usually start out with "He did WHAT to an F50???" :)

Brian is getting a nitrous kit installed in his viper, and Cash just got his suspension beefed up, so we will be off to the dragstrip again next month to sort everything out again.
