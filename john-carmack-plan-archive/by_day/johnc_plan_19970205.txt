I've been following the ferrari discussion on r.g.c.q, and here are a couple clarifications:

The final rounds will definately be one on one deathmatch over a LAN, probably double elimination.

The big question is how do we get the number of people who would like to take a shot at it down to a reasonable (64?) number of people for a proper tournement.

We don't know yet where the final rounds are going to be held, either.  E3? #Quakecon? A microsoft event? A totally specific event?

I know that whatever we come up with won't be 100% fair to our entire customer base, but it would be really unfortunate if some people got bitter over it.
