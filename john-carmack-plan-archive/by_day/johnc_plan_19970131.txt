I went down to the ferrari dealership today with Ann and American with the intention of buying a new f355 as a "sensible" car (in contrast to my other twin turbo monstrosities).

There was an F40 sitting out front.

Umm.  Sensible car.  F40.  Sensible car.  F40.  Hmmmm.

American played the evil conscience and Ann played the good conscience.  For a while.  Then Ann got infected by the Dark Side.  :-) I bought the F40.

Ok, I now have too many ferraris.  I have a plan to fix that.  This hasn't gone through all the legal crap necessary yet, but it is my intention to give away my first ferrari as the grand prize of a Quake tournement.

Yes, I am serious.

DO NOT SEND ME ANY MAIL ABOUT THIS! When we have more to say about it, we will make a formal announcement.  This would be a good time to start a heated debate in the newsgroups about what the fairest tourney rules would be, though.

The specs:  

1987 328 GTS with turbocharged engine.
Feature in the january, 1994 issue of Turbo magazine.
Made 360 HP at the rear wheels on a chassis dyno.
New engine (I melted the first one...), new paint.
The interior could use a little work.

I plan to also include enough cash to cover tax and insurance.
