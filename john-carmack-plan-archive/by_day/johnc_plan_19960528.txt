* QuakeEd: forbid dragging position / direction when textured
* constrained all file writes to the game directory to close security
holes
* allow multiple pak files intermixed with directory trees in the search
path
* full specification with: -basedir, -game, -cachepath, or -path
* moved demo list to cls, fixed efrag bug on second demo playback

+ bring up menu on any input during demos
+ do "loading" plaque from demo to demo
+ demo transition problem
+ automatic pak grabbing frame game dir
+ saving while in a trigger field kills it?
