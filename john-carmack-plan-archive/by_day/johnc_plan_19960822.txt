The rendition 3d accelerated version of Quake looks very good.

The image quality is significantly better than software - dithered, bilinear interpolated textures, and subpixel, subtexel polygon  models.

It is faster than software even at 320*200, and at 512*384 it is  almost twice as fast.

We do take a bit of a hit when we have to generate a lot of 16 bit  surfaces, so occasionally the framerate gets a bit uneven, but  overall it is a very solid improvement.
