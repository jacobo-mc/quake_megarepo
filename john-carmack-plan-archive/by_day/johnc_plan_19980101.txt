Some of the things I have changed recently:

* fixed the cinematics
* don't clear config after dedicated server
* don't reallocate sockets unless needed
* don't process channel packets while connecting
* rate variable for modem bandwidth choking
* delta compress client usercmds
* fixed sound quality changing after intermissions
* fixed PVS problem when head was directly under solid in GL
* added r_drawflat and cl_testlights to cheats

There are a few problems that I am still trying to track down:

WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL errors
Map versions differ error
Sometimes connecting and seeing messages but not getting in
Decompression read overrun.

Of course, we don't actually get any of those errors on any of our systems here, so I am having to work remotely with other users to try and fix them, which is a bit tougher.

My new years resolution is to improve my coding style by bracing all single line statements and consistantly using following caps on multi word variable names.

Actually, I am currently trying on the full sun coding style, but I'm not so sure about some of the comment conventions: don't use multiple lines of // comments, and don't use rows of seperating characters in comments. I'm not convinced those are good guidelines.
