* 10 crosshairs to select from (cg_drawCrosshair 1 - 10)
* cg_crosshairx / cg_crosshairy adjustment. I'm not convinced these are a good thing, because the crosshair is accurate in Q3 at the default position (unlike Q2, which had an offset firing position)
* more packet encryption
* join as spectator in all team games
* cg_predictItems 0 option to not do local prediction of item pickup
* rank players counting ties, so the third player when the lead is tied is third place, not second
* properly stack all status elements in upper right and lower right corners so they can all be visible
* faced q3map problem giving black corners in vertex light
* fixed +button4 not causing footsteps
* fixed bad groundplane clipping on angled jumppads
* show "snc" on lagometer when g_syncronousClients
* new shader command: rgbgen const ( )
* new shader command: agen const
* snap dropped item positions
* randomized offsets of bubbles
* fixed cgame restarts processing snapshots from 0
* proper setup for external/predictable player events
* fixed q3map vertex lighting bug after alphashadows
* do personal pain sounds on health transitions so they can never be missed
* timeout clear player events
* fixed hang in UI_ProportionalStringWidth
* quad event implicit on weapon fire
* fixed gamestate not retransmitting bug
* fixed timeout issue when paused
* subdivide command times if <15fps, fixing low com_maxfps physics exploits
* fixed footsteps playing when walking backwards
* new options at start of animation.cfg file: footsteps, headoffset
