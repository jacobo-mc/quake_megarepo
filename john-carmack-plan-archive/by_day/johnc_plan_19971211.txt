The Quake 2 public code release is up at:

ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/source/q2source_12_11.zip

This source code distribution is only for hard-core people that are going to spend a lot of time pouring over it. This is NOT a how-to-make-levels-for-q2 type dsitribution!

This should keep a bunch of you busy for a while. :)
