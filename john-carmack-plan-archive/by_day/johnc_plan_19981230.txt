I got several vague comments about being able to read "stuff" from shared memory, but no concrete examples of security problems.

However, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that it wouldn't work cross platform with 64 bit pointer environments like linux alpha. That is a killer, so I will be forced to do everything the hard way. Its probably for the best, from a design standpoint anyway, but it will take a little more effort.
