Zoid commented that my last .plan update sounded like Fred Brooks "The Mythical Man-Month". He is certainly correct.

When I read TMMM two years ago, I was stunned by how true and relevent it was. I have something of a prejudice against older computer books - I think "If its more than a five years old, it can't be very relevent" (sure, thats not too rational, but what prejudice is?).

Then I go and read this book that is TWENTY YEARS old, that talks about experience gained IN THE SIXTIES, and I find it mirroring (and often crystalizing) my thoughts on development as my experiences have taught me.

It even got me fired up about documenting my work. For about a day :)

I had to fly out to CA for biz on thursday, so I decided to grab and re-read TMMM on the plane.

It was just as good the second time through, and two more years of development under my belt hasn't changed any of my opinions about the contents.

If you program (or even work around software development), you should read this book.
