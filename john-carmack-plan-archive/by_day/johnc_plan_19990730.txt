I apologize for not getting the Mac version released this last time.

All conspiracy theories aside, here is what actually happened:

I had my San Jose travel scheduled a while ago, and we were expecting to have the release done before I left. We didn't quite make it, and nobody else at the office knew how to build the mac version after Cash made some last minute changes.

When I got back, Graeme was taking off to move his family down here. Graeme is in charge of building all the installs for our releases.

I considered just tossing new executables with the latest fixes for everything, but some data has changed, and it just isn't worth the hassle right now.

We will be making proper new releases for all architectures monday night when he gets back.
