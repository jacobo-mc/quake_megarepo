I just read the Wired article about all the Doom spawn.

I was quoted as saying "like I'm supposed to be scared of Monolith", which is much more derogatory sounding than I would like.

I haven't followed Monolith's development, and I don't know any of their technical credentials, so I am not in any position to evaluate them.

The topic of "is microsoft going to crush you now that they are in the game biz", made me a bit sarcastic.

I honestly wish the best to everyone pursuing new engine development.
