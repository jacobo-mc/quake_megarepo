trinity: fully compressed textures need to compress the mip levels as well, instead of generating them from the most detailed form.
trinity: different packing options to layout all the texture blocks. Square, thin, individual, etc.
trinity: investigate performance of background disk paging and clustering of texture blocks into disk allocation units
trinity: texture connectivity graph for prepaging?
trinity: speculatively upload things that might be seen next frame to balance uploading?
max upload, use lower mip levels if needed?

get rid of all the gl lightmaps in main memory!
allow jump up off bottom of water floor to give more velocity
merge net_udp and net_wins

slippery slopes
learned something: upload mip levels backwards
