More extensive comments on the interpreted-C decision later, but a quick note: the plan is to still allow binary dll loading so debuggers can be used, but it should be interchangable with the interpreted code. Client modules can only be debugged if the server is set to allow cheating, but it would be possible to just use the binary interface for server modules if you wanted to sacrifice portability. Most mods will be able to be implemented with just the interpreter, but some mods that want to do extensive file access or out of band network communications could still be implemented just as they are in Q2. I will not endorse any use of binary client modules, though.
