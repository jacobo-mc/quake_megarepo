<p><font face="Arial"><a name="To install the patch:"><font size="4"><strong>To install
the patch:<br>
</strong></font></a><font size="3">If your version of Hexen adheres to the requirements
above, simply double-click the patch executable, &quot;ph2v111.exe.&quot; </font></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">If you are patching the original version of Hexen, v.1.03,
or the original version of <em>Hexen II: Continent of Blackmarsh</em> v.1.08, you will
&nbsp; need an additional 75 megs of free hard drive space for the duration of the
patching process since the patch must make a copy of your large game files before it
patches them. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The patch process is automatic and may take a few minutes
or a few seconds depending on which version of the game you are patching (1.03 takes
minutes, 1.09 takes seconds). If you encounter problems, see &quot;Troubleshooting&quot;
below.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">* Multiplayer save/load works in Coop. All players must

from a server when another player joins.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">* A new command &quot;commands&quot; creates command.txt,
which contains a straight listing of all commands available in the game (note that
GL-specific commands will not be generated if you use &quot;commands&quot; in H2.exe).</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">If the patch encounters a problem running the patch (see
&quot;Note&quot; above) and terminates, perform the following steps:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">1) Back up your config.cfg and autoexec.bat files and any
  saved game folders located in the Hexen II\Data1 folder</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">2) Completely uninstall Hexen II (go Start
  Menu&gt;Programs&gt;Hexen II&gt;Uninstall Hexen II)</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">3) Delete the Hexen II directory</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">4) (Optional) Run RegClean just to be safe</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">5) Install Hexen II (make sure you use the Max option)</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">6) Run the patch</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">If the patch stops working consistently in the same place
while it is in progress (ex: if it consistently quits at 94% while patching pak1.pak), you
may have a corrupted patch file. If this is the case, do the following:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">1) Download a clean patch file from <a
  href="http://www.activision.com/games/action/hexenII/index.html">here</a>.&nbsp; Note, if
  that link does not work, try clicking <a
  href="http://www.activision.com/hexenII/index.html">here</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">2) Back up your config.cfg and autoexec.bat files and any
  saved game folders located in the Hexen II\Data1 folder</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">3) Completely uninstall Hexen II (go Start
  Menu&gt;Programs&gt;Hexen II&gt;Uninstall Hexen II)</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">4) Delete the Hexen II directory</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">5) Install Hexen II (make sure you use the Max option)</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">6) Run the patch</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size="3">If you get an error message </font><font
color="#000000" size="3">reading, &quot;Old file not found,&quot; and you are sure you
have met all the patch criteria (full retail install, etc.), make sure that your CDROM
drive is working properly and all drivers are up to date. We have seen some instances
where older CDROM drives actually make subtle corruptions to the game files as they are
installed to the hard drive. These corruptions result in minor alterations to the file
size and other means by which the patch program validates the target file, resulting in
the &quot;Old file not found&quot; error.</font></font></p>
