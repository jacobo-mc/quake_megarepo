Hexen II Mission Pack Patch Version:  v.1.12a
by Raven and Activision

Release Notes

This patch will upgrade the H2MP from v.1.12 to v.1.12a.  Patch v.1.12a
is not a mandatory patch; patched and unpatched servers and clients can
speak to each other without problems.

This patch addresses the following issues:

Game Crashed in Skill Level 4  -  If you managed to find the Easter egg
allowing you to play the game at Skill Level 4 (hint: it's in the first
level, keep1), you may have noticed that spiders and weretigers
respawning caused both the server and the client to crash.

Added Item Respawning in Skill 4  -  Just to help you out, we made some
useful items respawn when in skill 4.

Tibet10 Did Not Circulate - Tibet 10 (the final level) crashed in death-
match after reaching the timelimit or fraglimit.  Now it cycles back to
Tibet 1.

Paladin's Axe Sometimes Crashed - The paladin's axe trail sometimes
tried to read the axe after it was removed.  This caused the client to
crash to the console.

Tibet 9 Breaking Floor Was Rather Hard If You Didn't Jump Off In Time. -
The breaking floor in Tibet 9 was set to instantly kill the player when
it dropped.  Now it doesn't.

Dropped Items on Tibet 10 Would Respawn  -  This was a bug in the code,
which allowed certain items to respawn in Tibet 10.

Some Pentacles Could Cause Error - Untargeted Pentacles could crash the
world or the players weapons.

Dropped Mana Would Always Respawn - You may have noticed a message
saying that you have picked up Blue Mana, but did not see any.  This bug
had been around a long time.
