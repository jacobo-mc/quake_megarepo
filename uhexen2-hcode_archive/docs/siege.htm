<p ALIGN="CENTER">Siege:</font><font FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light"></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">A multilplayer mod for HexenWorld</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Overview &amp; Objective</b></p>

<p>Siege for HexenWorld is the one of the first fully realized attempts to bring a certain
level of strategy and realism to the 3D shoot-em-up genre. Instead of your typical
frag-fest, Siege presents the player with a more in depth and entertaining experience.
This experience can most easily be summarized as a &quot;First Person Warcraft&quot;.
Siege attempts to bring intelligence and planning to the multiplayer FPS, traditionally
the realm of mindless deathmatch. It combines entertaining gameplay, real world psychics,
balanced characters, numerous options, and many surprises.</p>

<p>The basic premise behind Siege is a confrontation between an attacking team and a
defending team. The attacker&#146;s goal is to besiege the defender&#146;s castle and
steal the crown. The defenders on the other hand, need to be able to hold off the
attackers long enough, thereby effectively deterring the enemy from gaining control of the
castle. If the crown is stolen within the allotted time, the attacker wins, if not, the
defender wins. Depending on the number of players, this time limit can be set by the
server, otherwise default time is usually around 30 minutes. The game is a race against
time, and both sides have many tools at their disposal in order to insure victory. How
effectively they use what they are given though will ultimately determine the outcome.
This is where strategy plays a key role in Siege. There is no one way to approach the
game, there are many strategies that can be employed by either side. Most of the fun in
Siege derives from successfully discovering new tactics and strategies. The game never
gets boring because it presents players with flexibility and rewards them for their
ingenuity. This truly sets Siege apart from most of the other multiplayer mods available
and offers an interesting and engaging alternative to the typical pointless frag-fest of
most 3D games of this nature. Siege is also set apart by the realism it offers to the
player. The player is challenged to a certain degree by a small learning curve that is
required by most character classes or by certain weapons of destruction, such as catapults
or ballistae. Since realism is a key factor in Siege, nothing is as easy as it seems. Some
classes are inept in certain areas and mastering the catapults is a small challenge in and
of itself, making the reward of success that much sweeter. Much play testing and
experimentation has been instrumental in making the game a very balanced and enjoyable
experience. Siege is clever and entertaining 3D gameplay that successfully blends action,
realistic gameplay and strategy in a multiplayer environment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Beginning the Battle</p>
    </b><p>Everyone comes into the game in a small room with two teleporters. The left(red)
    teleporter depicting a ballista is the Defender teleport. The right(blue) teleporter
    depicting a catapult is the Attacker teleport. Choose your team by stepping though the
    desired teleporter. On the other side you will find yourself in your base or barracks. You
    will notice that your team is either clad in blue and silver with a Crescent Moon symbol
    (attackers) or in red and gold with a Sun symbol (defenders). This will aid you in easily
    identifying your team mates. </p>
    <p>In each base there is a button that has the message &quot;Press When Ready&quot;. When
    all your players are in and ready to begin the battle, press this button. When both
    buttons are pressed, the exits to the bases open and the timer starts counting down again
    from the top. This ensures that everyone starts at the same time.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Time Limit</p>
    </b><p>The time limit defaults to 30 minutes. In the bottom right you will see a display
    that shows you how much time is left until the attackers lose. This timelimit starts
    counting down as soon as the map starts, but don&#146;t worry, it resets as soon as the
    battle is begun.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Frag Limit</p>
    </b><p>This is how many people the defenders can lose before forfeiting control of the
    castle. If this number of defenders is lost, the attackers win automatically. You can see
    the number of defenders lost and the total number available in the same lower right
    display next to the shield symbol. The attackers have 3 times as many men to lose as the
    defenders. Their losses and reserves are indicated by the numbers next to the sword in the
    same display.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">DM Info screen</p>
    </b><p>Bringing up your standard DM info screen (&quot;+showdm&quot;) will tell you the
    colors and frags of each player as well as their name, ping and connect time. In addition,
    before the players name is info on the playerclass, team, and level of the player.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Objectives</p>
    </b><p>The goal of the attackers is to break into the castle and capture the King&#146;s
    Crown from the defenders. The defenders&#146; only goal is to stop them. </p>
    <u><p>Attackers:</p>
    </u><p>The attackers initial objective is to break down the tops of the ramparts with
    explosive barrels launched from their catapults. Once they have broken these ramparts,
    they may safely catapult themselves over if they can clear the spikes. Once over, they
    need to lower the drawbridge and open the main gate to let in the others. However, in case
    they get killed and have get over the walls again, it is best to try to break the chains
    for the drawbridge. Doing this will lower it permanently. Now the only remaining obstacle
    is the main gate. This can be broken after quite some effort, but the best way to break it
    is to have a Necromancer become a beast and ram it over and over until it breaks. Now you
    have free reign inside the castle and it is only a matter of time before you find the key.
    In the first tower there is a Cube of Force that will lead you to the key when activated.
    Once you have the key, you must break into the King&#146;s Tower (the second tower). You
    will meet some resistance here, but remember that every door or gate that is a barrier to
    your progress may be broken (besides the door to the Throne Room and the door to the
    defender barracks). Once inside the King&#146;s Tower, it is a simple matter to ascend the
    spiral stairs and fight your way into the Throne Room and capture the crown.</p>
    <p>It is quite possible that all your catapults could be destroyed. At this point, you
    will find that there are a couple other ways into the castle, aside from sending in a
    flying Succubus or wall-climbing Assassin. There are two other ways to get in the castle,
    but none as good as breaking down the front doors. It is also possible that you could be
    imprisoned by the defenders&#146; enchanted Icon of the Defender. If you find yourself in
    prison, alert your teammates to arrange a jailbreak or attempt to find a weakness in the
    cell and break out yourself.</p>
    <u><p>Defenders:</p>
    </u><p>Your first objective should be to secure the Throne Room Key and ensure it&#146;s
    safety. This is the most important element of the attacker&#146;s success and you should
    either put it in the best hiding spot you can or give it to the best player on your team.
    Next, you must address the problem of three catapults hammering on your front door. There
    are 4 ballistae on the two front towers. The bottom two have doors that block them and can
    be opened and closed with the &quot;Use&quot; key. These are better defended than the top
    ballistae, but the top ballistae have more range and a better range of fire. You should
    try to prevent the attackers from launching barrels while killing as many attackers as you
    can. You should mainly concern yourself with destroying the catapults, however, since that
    will force your attackers to find another way into the castle. There are also arrow-loops
    at the base of each front tower to allow you to fire out of the base of the towers with
    very good protection. </p>
    <p>If the attackers do manage to break a hole in your ramparts, be sure to have someone
    watching the switches for the drawbridge so that they do now open the gates and let in the
    main force or possibly even destroy the chains supporting the drawbridge. It is quite
    possible that you could lose all your ballistae. If this happens, you should be prepared
    to be dealing with a onslaught of attackers within the front court. It may help to have
    someone ready to imprison attackers and prevent jailbreaks. If the attackers have gained
    easy access to the front of the castle, it is time to fall back and close the porticullis
    to the inner courtyard. There is a switch in the inner courtyard that closes this
    porticullis as well as doors that seal off the other entrances to the courtyard on the
    higher level. The attackers will have to break down at least one of those doors to get in.
    If you lose one of those doors, your last line of defense are a few monsters that will
    help you fight the attackers as they try to break down the door to the Throne Tower. If
    the attackers manage to break down that door and have the key to the Throne Room, your
    only hope is to battle them on the spiral steps leading up to the Throne Room and stop
    them at any cost. It is here that the Paladin and Succubus are most useful as they are the
    best straight fighters. The Necromancer will be helpful here with his destructive spells
    and the Crusader can help keep the defenders alive and boost them, perhaps even
    sacrificing himself to take out a good number of attackers. Only the Assassin and Dwarf
    will be of little use at this point in the game.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Winning the Game</p>
    </b><p>There are two ways for the attackers to win and two ways for the defenders to win.
    The defenders win if the time limit is reached or if they kill all the attackers. The
    attackers win if they capture the crown or kill all the defenders. A victory splash screen
    will come up and a small fanfare will play informing all of the outcome. To the victors go
    the spoils and the losers must wait for another day to redeem their honor.</p>
    <b><font SIZE="5"><p ALIGN="CENTER">Character Classes and Modifications</p>
    </font><font FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light"><p ALIGN="CENTER">PALADIN</p>
    </font></b><p>The paladin is a brute strength brawler- he is a deadly in-fighter and is
    the second best player for breaking down barriers. He is the strongest character and
    starts with the second most health. While he may not seem to have any really special
    abilities, he is a natural leader, and for Defenders, a leader is sorely needed&#133;</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Weapons</p>
    </b><i><p>Sword</i> &#150; Has a good range and in the hands of a paladin, can decapitate
    enemies with ease.</p>
    <i><p>Axe</i> &#150; Isn&#146;t quite as good for melee fighting as the sword, but the axe
    is the best weapon for breaking wood.</p>
    <i><p>Shortbow</i> &#150; The paladin&#146;s brute strength makes him able to fire his
    arrows a good distance, but he has little to no skill with the weapon making is extremely
    inaccurate.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Spells</p>
    </b><p>The paladin has no spells.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Abilities</p>
    </b><i><p>Free Action</i> &#150; The paladin can move through water as if on land and can
    hold his breath longer. This makes him the best candidate for braving the piranhas in the
    moat and attempting to break in through the sewer.</p>
    <i><p>Divine Intervention</i> &#150; The paladin occasionally will be preserved by his god
    when killed.</p>
    <font FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light"><b><p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">ASSASSIN</p>
    </b></font><p>The assassin is the stealth character. She is fast and deadly. She is good
    for either offense or defense. She is the fastest of the group, but also has no spells.
    Her great accuracy with her effective weapons combined with her ability to scale walls
    makes her a highly desirable addition to a Siege Attacker&#146;s party.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Weapons</p>
    </b><i><p>Dagger</i> &#150; A fast but weak weapon, however, her backstabbing ability
    makes it more powerful if used correctly.</p>
    <i><p>Shortbow</i> &#150; The assassin is an expert with the shortbow and has the best
    firing rate with it. While her lower strength makes it so she cannot shoot it quite as far
    as a paladin, she can hit a target with accuracy.</p>
    <i><p>Crossbow</i> &#150; The assassin&#146;s crossbow is a long-range, straight-firing
    weapon that requires her to stand still and aim carefully while shooting. It can propel
    flaming arrows with great speed and do a lot of damage.</p>
    <i><p>Tripwire</i> &#150; The tripwires are used to lay traps around corners or behind
    curtains. An assassin being chased can also use the tripwires as a nice way to dispatch
    her pursuers.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Spells</p>
    </b><p>The assassin has no spells.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Abilities</p>
    </b><i><p>Backstab</i> &#150; As part of the assassin&#146;s stealth and assassination
    skills, she can deliver a heinous blow with her dagger if the victim is facing away from
    her.</p>
    <i><p>Hide in Shadows</i>&#150; The assassin will fade out in areas of darkness.</p>
    <i><p>Spiderclimb</i>- The assassin has the ability to grab onto surfaces and scale them.
    However, this is a slow process and she makes a good amount of noise doing so. She also
    cannot fire or use any items while climbing. If she is hit while climbing, she will fall
    off the wall.</p>
    <font FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light"><b><p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">CRUSADER</p>
    </b></font><p>The crusader is a mix of a cleric and a fighter. He only has one weapon, but
    he can boost both himself and others with a variety of cheap, but powerful spells.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Weapons</p>
    </b><i><p>Hammer</i> &#150; The crusader&#146;s hammer is a nice average all-purpose
    weapon that can be turned into a powerful ranged weapon when enchanted.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Spells (mana cost)</p>
    </b><i><p>Heal(5)</i> &#150; Can be cast on himself or others. Heals 5 points of damage,
    but will not raise your health above your maximum health.</p>
    <i><p>Enchant Hammer(10)</i> &#150; Turns your hammer into a magically enchanted hammer
    you can throw a short distance and will magically return to you. This spell lasts 60
    seconds.</p>
    <i><p>Turn Undead(15- Not Implemented)</i> &#150;May change. Was intended to repel
    Necromancers, Succubi, and Summoned Imps.</p>
    <i><p>Mercurial Speed(20)</i> &#150; Gives you or a target player the speed of Mercury.</p>
    <i><p>Berzerker(30)</i> &#150; Multiplies the strength of the crusader or target player
    times 4. This strength fades quickly.</p>
    <i><p>Cloak of Perseus(40)</i> &#150; Turns crusader or target invisible except for a
    trail of magical footsteps.</p>
    <i><p>Wrath of God(max)</i> &#150; You must have a full load of mana to cast this spell.
    It will cause everyone in front of you to be struck down by lightning and kills you as
    well.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Abilities</p>
    </b><i><p>Revivification</i> &#150; Every time the crusader goes up a level, he gets full
    health and full mana. (May be replaced with something more useful since there are no level
    increases in Siege)</p>
    <i><p>Holy Strength</i> &#150; When he kills someone, sometimes can pick a sphere that
    gives him double damage (may also be replaced)</p>
    <font FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light"><b><p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">NECROMANCER</p>
    </b></font><p>The Necromancer is not meant to fight a melee. If he does, he&#146;ll most
    likely get his ass whooped, and bad. He is weak and somewhat slow. But his strength is his
    offensive spells, which are somewhat more expensive than the Crusader&#146;s magic.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Weapons</p>
    </b><i><p>Sickle</i> &#150; His close-range weapon, it&#146;s the weakest melee weapon of
    the bunch.</p>
    <i><p>Shortbow</i> &#150; The necromancer can barely use this weapon. He&#146;s not very
    fast with it, but more accurate than the paladin. His physical weakness, however, makes it
    difficult for him to shoot very far or do much damage with it.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Spells (mana cost)</p>
    </b><i><p>Magic Missiles(2)</i> &#150; These are long-range but somewhat inaccurate
    manifestations of the Necromancer&#146;s naughtiness.</p>
    <i><p>Poison(20)</i> &#150; Poisons the target for a short amount of time, causing
    slowness and a loss of life over time.</p>
    <i><p>Polymorph(30)</i> &#150; Turns targets into sheep.</p>
    <i><p>Delayed Fireball(40)</i> &#150; Launches a glyph that explodes into a huge expanding
    fireball (basically, the paladin&#146;s glyph from Hexen 2)</p>
    <i><p>Summon Imp(60)</i> &#150; Summons an imp to do the Necromancer&#146;s bidding. If
    the Necromancer dies, the imp will die too.</p>
    <i><p>Become Beast(100)</i> &#150; Turns the Necromancer into a giant beast that can step
    on people and catapults, break down doors, and causes earthquakes when he jumps. This
    lasts for three minutes.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Abilities</p>
    </b><i><p>Soul Stealing</i> &#150; After killing someone, he sometimes can steal their
    soul for extra health (may be replaced by Necrophagy- see below)</p>
    <i><p>Vampiric Drain</i> &#150; When he hits with the sickle, he can steal mana from the
    victim.</p>
    <i><p>Necrophagy</i> (Not Implemented) When the necromancer steps over a dead body, he
    absorbs it into him and gains 5 health (but not over his max health).</p>
    <font FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light"><b><p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">SUCCUBUS</p>
    </b></font><p>The Succubus strikes a balance between fighter and mage- she is fairly fast,
    has average strength, 4 weapons and 4 spells. Her primary advantage is use of the skies.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Weapons</p>
    </b><i><p>Bloodrain</i> &#150; A short-range straight-fire projectile spell that requires
    no mana.</p>
    <i><p>Sword</i> &#150; Like the paladin&#146;s sword, it is a good weapon, but she is not
    a strong or fast with it.</p>
    <i><p>Shortbow</i> &#150; She is better with the crossbow than the necromancer or paladin,
    but does not equal the assassin's efficiency with it.</p>
    <i><p>Grenades</i> &#150; Probably the most destructive weapon available, these do not
    become available until the attackers have gotten pretty far into the castle.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Spells (mana cost)</p>
    </b><i><p>Repulsion(20)</i> &#150; Repels players and projectiles away from her.</p>
    <i><p>? (Not Implemented-40)</p>
    <p>Flame Shield (Not Implemented-60)</i>- The Succubus becomes enveloped in a shield of
    fire that stops small projectiles and burns others on contact.</p>
    <i><p>Flight(100)</i> &#150; Allows her to fly freely for 60 seconds.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Abilities</p>
    </b><i><p>Demon Glide</i> &#150; Holding down the jump button while in mid air will cause
    her to open her wings and glide slowly to the ground.</p>
    <i><p>Mana Absorption </i>&#150; Sometimes gains mana when she takes damage.</p>
    <i><p>Sadistic Glee (Not Implemented)</i> &#150; May gain health when she kills a person
    at close range.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <font FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light"><b><p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">DWARF</p>
    </b></font><p>The Dwarf is not a magic user or a particularly great melee fighter, but he
    is small, resilient, and the best digger/demolitionist of the classes. He has only 2
    weapons but excellent armor and three very useful abilities. He is a poor swimmer, has
    shorter reach, and is slower than the other characters.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Weapons</p>
    </b><i><p>Hammer</i> &#150; A solid pummeling weapon, very good for breaking stone.</p>
    <i><p>Axe</i> &#150; A better melee weapon than the hammer, the axe is also very useful
    for chopping into anything made of wood. Both weapons are products of fine Dwarven
    blacksmithing.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Spells (mana cost)</p>
    </b><p>The assassin has no spells.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Abilities</p>
    </b><i><p>InfraVision</i> &#150; The Dwarf can &quot;see&quot; heat waves off of other
    people. This is evident when a player walks into the shadows, he glows red in the
    Dwarf&#146;s view.</p>
    <i><p>Regeneration</i> &#150; The dwarf has excellent constitution and constantly
    regenerates health at a steady pace up to 75% of his maximum, and only if he is not in a
    berzerker rage.</p>
    <i><p>Berzerker Rage</i> &#150; If the Dwarf is low in health and is hit particularly
    hard, he may go into a fit of rage and become faster and much stronger, but will not
    regenerate health during this time.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The &quot;Use&quot; key returns!</b></p>

<p>The &quot;Use&quot; key is in the keyboard config screen as &quot;use object&quot;
&#150; it is impulse 13. This key is very important in Siege. It is used for the following
actions:</p>

<p>&nbsp;<u></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Climbing</u>: Face a wall and hit the &quot;Use&quot; key. This will put you in
    climbing mode. Then just face where you want to climb to and hold down the jump key. You
    will slowly progress in that direction as long as you hold the jump key. Hitting the
    &quot;Use&quot; key again will release you from the wall and return your jump key to
    normal jumping.</p>
    <u><p>Doors/Plats</u>: All the lifts in the map must be used by standing on them and
    hitting your &quot;Use&quot; key. The door to the Defender barracks and the individual
    prison cell doors must also be opened with the &quot;Use&quot; key. The prison cell doors
    can only be opened from the outside of the cell, obviously.</p>
    <u><p>Barrels</u>: To load a catapult, push a barrel up to the rear of the catapult, face
    the barrel, hit &quot;Use&quot; and push forward. The barrel will lift up and forward onto
    the catapult. If you put the &quot;skill&quot; console variable to &quot;0&quot;, the
    barrels will auto-load when pushed up to a catapult. There is one large barrel on the
    field that contains a Greek Fire mixture. To light this barrel, light a torch and then
    attempt to &quot;throw&quot; the torch at the barrel- you can be right next to the barrel
    to light it in this manner. Other fire and flaming arrows will also light these barrels.
    When they hit, they will start a good size fire that burns for 30 seconds.</p>
    <u><p>Catapults</u>: You can fire a catapult by hitting it with your first weapon, or by
    standing on it and jumping (if you want to launch yourself) or by hitting the fire button
    while you&#146;re in control of it. You gain control of it by standing in the center of
    the catapult. While in this mode, you can aim the catapult by turning slowly. The
    catapults can be moved a limited range by pushing at the front or back of the catapult and
    hitting the &quot;Use&quot; key.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Setting</b></p>

<p>The Defenders of the Crown are a lost people. Years ago, they had a great leader who
built a powerful, peaceful empire. He was a Great Paladin named Halcyon and his Golden
Crown is the foremost symbol of power in the region, and the bearer of the Crown can
easily lay claim to the now empty leadership. Their king also had a golden sword which,
according to legend, was presented to him from the bosom of the magical pool in the center
of the castle. According to legend this sword, named Excelsior, bestowed it&#146;s chosen
bearer with great strength, speed, and resilience. It is said only a great leader may bear
the sword. Excelsior was lost, however, long ago when Halcyon was slain by his closest
confidant, turned traitor by the evil influence of the Serpent Riders. It is said that
some day, a new leader will arise and lead the defenders to glory once again, and at that
time, Excelsior will return. But none have stepped forth. Furthermore, the long-standing
enemies of the Defenders of the Crown are the Order of the Crescent Moon. They were the
dominant power in the area before the advent of the Defenders of the Crown. The very place
the castle stands upon once was their holiest of temples. They will not rest until they
have reclaimed what they believe to be rightfully theirs.</p>

<p>The level that has been designed for &quot;Siege&quot; has been specifically made to
offer many obstacles and advantages to both attacker and defender. Besides the fact that
the castle has been constructed to effectively prevent the attacker from infiltrating it,
it still has its share of weaknesses and is not impregnable. From a designing standpoint,
this level was constructed with simplicity in mind, in order to meet the demanding needs
and limitations of network and modem play. I will present briefly how the castle was
designed and some of the many options available to the players:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>All the players start with all their weapons, but only the arrows are available as ammo
    from the beginning of the game. Later on, the Assassin&#146;s glyph will become available
    as will the Succubus&#146; grenades and more arrows.</p>
    <p>There are many doors in the castle that can be strategically sealed or shut off, but be
    forewarned, most doors are also breakable as well.</p>
    <p>Attackers are given maneuverable catapults that fire exploding barrels and defenders
    are given ballistae to guard the castle ramparts from destruction, and both of these
    weapons are NOT indestructible.</p>
    <p>The castle is equipped with a fully functional prison that can house up to eight enemy
    players, but that doesn&#146;t necessarily mean that you can&#146;t escape somehow once
    you&#146;re imprisoned. </p>
    <p>There is more than one way to get inside the castle, if you can somehow manage to
    survive a deadly moat full of ravenous killer piranhas!</p>
    <p>The castle is not only protected by the defenders, but by certain castle guardians that
    appear JUST at the right time.</p>
    <p>Both sides have access to a barracks area that can be used as a temporary safe haven or
    a meeting room to discuss various tactics, but don&#146;t hang around for too long, time
    is of an essence! </p>
    <p>The castle has breakable ramparts that must be destroyed before any attacker dares to
    catapult himself over the walls, lest they wish to be impaled by the bloody spikes that
    line the front of the castle.</p>
    <p>The castle crown can only be captured by successfully acquiring the key to the throne
    room, which may or may not prove to be a problem.</p>
    <p>There are many other secrets that I have not delved into; instead, I&#146;ll give the
    players the satisfaction of discovering them on their own!</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">Other Important Instructions</p>
    </b><p>&quot;Impulse 34&quot; will drop the Throne Room Key wherever you&#146;re standing.
    This is good for hiding the key so you don&#146;t leave it out in the open when you die.</p>
    <p>&quot;Icon of the Defender&quot; now acts as a device that, when aimed and fired
    immediately drops an attacking player&#146;s inventory and teleports him or her into a
    prison cell.</p>
    <p>There are team only triggers that can only be used by the right player; for example,
    the door to the defender barracks can only be opened and closed by a defender, not an
    attacker.</p>
    <p>The &quot;KILL&quot; command has been disabled in order to provide more realism and
    balance to the game.</p>
    <p>Mana is now only used by certain character classes and is not necessary for the use of
    character weapons; instead specific ammo has been placed on the map for various weapons.
    Mana is not picked up anywhere on the map, instead magic-users produce mana over time.</p>
    <p>The &quot;Force Cube&quot; now acts as a tracking device that will, roughly, lead you
    to the location of the throne room key.</p>
    <p>The &quot;Ring of Water Breathing&quot; now has a most desirable side effect.</p>
    <p>Team chat allows players to talk to each other without being overheard by the opposing
    team.</p>
    <p>Arrows cannot do damage to things with high health such as ballistae, catapults,
    ramparts and heavy doors. They can only really damage players, monsters and barrels.</p>
    <p>Targeted Spells:</p>
    <p>Some spells can be cast on the caster or a target. If you point at a player when
    casting the spell, it will cast it on them, otherwise, it will cast it on the caster.</p>
    <p>The map&#146;s lighting starts off in daylight and fade to nighttime over a course of
    10 &#150; 20 minutes, then fade back up again, simulating the passing of day and night.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Future Ideas and Implementations</p>
    </b><p>Different fantasy type settings for castles, for example, &quot;Ice Castle&quot;,
    &quot;Obsidian Tower&quot;, &quot;City of Troy&quot;, &quot;Forest Fort&quot;, &quot;Moon
    Base&quot;, etc.</p>
    <p>Different mission objectives such as, &quot;rescue the princess&quot;, &quot;destroy
    and pillage&quot;, &quot;escape from the castle&quot; or &quot;castle vs. castle.&quot;</p>
    <p>Battering ram that will allow attackers to break down the main portcullis with ease.</p>
    <p>Pots of hot oil that can be poured down from the castle ramparts.</p>
    <p>Cannons that fire&#133;well, cannonballs of course!</p>
    <p>For those Monty Python fans, castles that launch out cows and other barnyard animals.</p>
    <p>Moving bridges and ladders that can be used to scale the castle walls.</p>
    <p>There will be a few more abilities (designed for Siege specifically) eventually.</p>
