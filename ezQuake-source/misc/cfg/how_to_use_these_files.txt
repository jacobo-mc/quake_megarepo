of scripts and settings of features.

You can execute these configs by typing e.g. "/exec cfg/movement.cfg"
into the console.

keyboard binds, basic commands like ready/break and player tracking on numpad,
very basic screen setup and Qizmo proxy navigation keyboard binds. 
Configuration files teamplay.cfg and eq260.cfg contain keyboard binds for

Configuration file teamtime.cfg contains script that helps you time items
through teamplay messages with your teammates.

Configs with the name starting with 'gfx_*' are used by the game engine when
you choose different values for "Graphics settings" option in the Options menu.
Usually you don't care much what is in those files and you don't need to
customize them but you might wish to change something in them so the menu option
suits your needs.
