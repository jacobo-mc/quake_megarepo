What is it ?
------------

This GTKRadiant 1.2+ plugin handles the extracting of files from .WAD files.
I'll refer to these files as .HLW files, even though they don't have any
extension when they're stored in the .WAD file itself.

You need an image plugin to go with this plugin that can read .HLW files
My ImageHL plugin does just this.

Developer Notes
---------------

The project file will copy the compiled DLL file and this .TXT file to
"$(HLRADIANTDIR)\modules" so make sure you have that environment variable
defined.

For my GTKRadiant 1.2 HalfLife game pack files I use the directory:
"E:\games\HalfLife\Tools\GTKR12N\".  Under which there are the directories
"modules" and "plugins"

Thanks to the guys that made Wally for releasing an example WAD loader.
without it this would not have been possible.
