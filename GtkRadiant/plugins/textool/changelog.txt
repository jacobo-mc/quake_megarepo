first usable version
here is the TODO-list for next release, ( most certainly a wish list )

- TODO: add hooks with the selected face and selected patch data. tell the plugin when selected face
or selected patch has changed.
the hooks should use a generic interface inside Radiant for "observers"
- TODO: add other usefull texturing tools, if designers come up with good ideas
