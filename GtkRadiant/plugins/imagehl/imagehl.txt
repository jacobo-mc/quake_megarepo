What is it ?
------------

This GTKRadiant 1.2+ plugin handles the loading of textures from .WAD files.
I'll refer to these textures as .HLW files, even though they don't have any
extension when they're stored in the .WAD file itself.

You need a VFS plugin to go with this plugin that can open and read .WAD files
My VFSWAD plugin does just this.

Developer Notes
---------------

The project file will copy the compiled DLL file and this .TXT file to
"$(HLRADIANTDIR)modules" so make sure you have that environment variable
defined.

For my GTKRadiant 1.2 HalfLife game pack files I use the directory:
"E:\games\HalfLife\Tools\GTKR12N".  Under which there are the directories
"modules" and "plugins"

Credits

Thanks to the guys that made Wally for releasing an example WAD loader.
without it this would not have been possible.
