DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
=======================

There are 3 model wedges in the map that are auto-clipped.  The middle wedge
with the 45 degree slope is the problem.  The slope face does not become solid;
therefore, there is a nonsolid "hole" on the wedge part.  The other two wedges
are fine.  45 degrees seems to be a problem for model clipping.
