DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
=======================

The provided map, maps/base_winding.map, serves as an example map to test
changes to BaseWindingForPlane().  This map has planes at many different
angles.  Use the patch base_winding_logging.patch to log the computed
base windings, in order to compare before and after when making changes to
BaseWindingForPlane().
