// cvar.h

/*

cvar_t variables are used to hold scalar or string variables that can be changed
or displayed at the console or prog code as well as accessed directly in C code.

it is sufficient to initialize a cvar_t with just the first two fields, or
you can add a ,true flag for variables that you want saved to the configuration
file when the game is quit:

cvar_t	r_draworder = {"r_draworder","1"};
cvar_t	scr_screensize = {"screensize","1",true};

Cvars must be registered before use, or they will have a 0 value instead of the
float interpretation of the string. Generally, all cvar_t declarations should be
registered in the apropriate init function before any console commands are executed:
Cvar_Register (&host_framerate);

C code usually just references a cvar in place:
if (r_draworder.value)

It could optionally ask for the value to be looked up for a string name:
if (Cvar_VariableValue ("r_draworder"))

Interpreted prog code can access cvars with the cvar(name) or
cvar_set (name, value) internal functions:
teamplay = cvar("teamplay");
cvar_set ("registered", "1");

The user can access cvars from the console in two ways:
r_draworder		prints the current value
r_draworder 0		sets the current value to 0
Cvars are restricted from having the same names as commands to keep this
interface from being ambiguous.
