than one AVI file. The used video capture module has a problem with files
getting corrupted when reaching a size of over 2 gigabytes, so splitting them
into smaller files is a good idea to avoid this corruption. Default is
1900 megabytes. Setting to 0 disables splitting.

To turn it off you need to start joequake with the following command line:

```
+set cl_independentphysics 0
```

### `vid_displayfrequency`

Set texture filtering mode for sky textures. Valid modes: `GL_LINEAR` and
`GL_NEAREST`, `GL_LINEAR` by default.

### `net_connectsearch`

Allows to enable or disable the search for hosts on use of the `connect`
command. It allows connecting by the server's hostname instead of by IP address.
However, the search takes a significant amount of time. So disabling it can
greatly speedup the time it takes to connect to a server by IP address.
"1" by default. Set to "0" to try to speedup connecting by IP address.

### `net_getdomainname`

Allows to enable or disable trying to find domain names for IP addresses using
DNS lookups. These can find domain names like nl2.badplace.eu from its IP
address. However, on Windows this lookup seems to take a long time. Disabling it
can therefore speed up connecting to a server significantly. As there will
barely be any usecase for the domain names, it is "0" by default. Set to "1" to
restore the original Quake behaviour with the lookups enabled.

## New commands

### `cmdlist`

Lists all console commands.

### `cvarlist`

Lists all console variables.

### `gamedir <path>`

Changes the mod's directory.
If you started Quake with e.g. `-game ctf` and during the game
you wish to play with an other mod, you can change it dinamically,
without quitting the game.
Relative pathnames like "newdir/ctf" are not allowed.

### `dir <wildcard>`

Lists all files matching wildcard.
Works the same way like other shells' dir command.

### `demdir <wildcard>`

The same as dir, except that this cmd is only for .dem files.
So please omit the .dem extension from the wildcard.

### `menu_demos`

Pops up the Demos menu, the same as you enter it from the Main Menu

### `writeconfig <filename>`

Writes a .cfg file with your actual game settings.

### `printtxt <filename>`

Prints a text file into the console.
You can now read SDA demos' txt files without quitting the game :)

### `getcoords <filename>`

Writes the player's origin into the given file or to "camfile.cam" if there
was no filename given.

### `volumeup`, `volumedown`

volumeup increases the volume by 0.1 and volumedown decreases by the same value.
The maximum volume is 1.0, it won't raise higher than that. You'll see a graphical
volume control bar at the top right corner of the screen for 2 seconds any time
you change the volume using volumeup or volumedown.

### `iplog`, `ipmerge`, `identify`

These commands are exported from ProQuake.
Please read the ProQuake documentation on using them.

### `loadsky <filename>`

Loads a custom skybox.
As you know (or not) a skybox consists of 6 images (6 sides of a box).
To set a skybox, you only have to add the common name of these six files,
since they contain 2 characters of skybox extension at the end.
For example, you have a skybox called "day", you have six images called
dayrt, daybk, daylf, dayft, dayup, daydn.
Than you only have to use `loadsky day`.
To get skyboxes, go to the FuhQuake page.
Skyboxes goes to "/env" directory.
This command also sets `r_skybox`'s value. You can change skyboxes through
this cvar as well.

### `loadcharset <filename>`

Loads an external console charset.
Console charsets should be placed inside textures/charsets dir.

### `capture_start <filename>`

Starts capturing an .avi file.

### `capture_stop`

Stops capturing.

### `capturedemo <filename>`

Starts playing a demo and starts capturing it also with the same name.

### `keepdemo`

See description about `cl_autodemo` in the Cvars section.

### `toggleparticles`

Changes all `gl_part_*` vars' values between 0 (off), 1 (QMB) or 2 (Quake3).
A pleasant way if you wouldn't like to set all variables one by one.

### `toggledecals`

Changes all `gl_decals_*` vars' values to their opposite.

### `fog`

Applies fog to the map. Used implicitly by newer maps.
Usage:
`fog <density>`
`fog <red> <green> <blue>`
`fog <density> <red> <green> <blue>`
`<density>` defines the thickness of the fog.
`<red> <green> <blue>` values define the color of the fog.

## Other features

### Parameter completion

I think people will prefer this feature alot more to using `dir` or `demdir`.
Parameter completion means if you're using a command requiring a filename
(`playdemo` for example), then when you're pressing TAB you're gonna get a list
of files matching to the written wildcard, just as `dir` or `demdir`.
For example you typed the following to the console:

```
]playdemo e1m1
```

After pressing TAB you're getting a list of all e1m1*.dem files.
The wildcard will be updated with the longest common string of the matching
filenames. If only one file was found, the wildcard's gonna be replaced with
that. It's that simple :) but it's handy imho.

Parameter completion works for the following commands:
`playdemo`, `capture_start`, `capturedemo`, `printtxt`, `map`, `exec`, `load`,
`loadsky`, `r_skybox`, `loadcharset`, `gl_consolefont` and `crosshairimage`.
None of them require any extension to be given, they'll automatically find
their filetypes.

### Maps, Demos, Mods menu

JoeQuake added 3 new menus to Quake:
The Maps menu contains a list of all available maps in the actual path
including inside pak files as well.
The Demos menu gives you a shell about all the Quake subdirectories, and you
may browse between these dirs and watch demos in any folder.
The Mods menu also shows all the Quake subdirectories, and choosing any of them
reloads the specific mod immediately (as if you have started Quake `-game <moddir>`)

### 32bit textures support (GL only)

The whole function copied from FuhQuake which contained loading TGA and PNG
images and I extended this with JPEG/JPG support as well. The handling of
directories is purely the same as in FuhQuake:

All textures go to a "textures" folder, which can contain subfolders:

* "bmodels" for brush model textures (i.e. textures/bmodels)
* "models" for alias model textures (i.e. textures/models)
* "sprites" for sprite model textures (i.e. textures/sprites)
* "wad" for hud pictures (i.e. textures/wad)
* "charsets" for custom character sets (i.e. textures/charsets)
* "particles" for custom particle images (i.e. textures/particles)

You can also create map name folders, so then the textures for that map will
be loaded from there (e.g. textures/ztndm3).
The only difference to FuhQuake is that JoeQuake doesn't use map groups, so
don't try "exmy" folder for id1 maps as you did in FuhQuake.

I can only provide a few hud textures made by myself, but if you want more,
head over to the FuhQuake page and download the installer which contain lots
of cool textures to plenty of maps, status bar images, new menu pictures etc.
You can also get textures from the Quake Retexturing project:
<http://www.quake.cz/winclan/qe1>

(NOTE that there're no textures/ parent folder in the following paths)
Custom crosshairimages go to "crosshairs" folder.
Custom skyboxes go either to "env" or to "gfx/env" folder.

### Coloured lights (GL only)

Both dynamic and static colored lights are available in JoeQuake.
You can choose from various colors to set your explosion or rocket lightning.
For static colored lights, you can find a .lit files (files containing the color
information for maps) package on the FuhQuake page.

You may place lit files either to "maps/lits" or to "lits" folder.

### Avi capturing

JoeQuake uses avi capturing written by Anthony Bailey.
An important thing you should know about: this is mainly for capturing demos,
not gameplay.

Sound issues: capturing supports up to 44 KHz sounds too, but I personally don't
recommend recording the audio on that sample. The reason is that all the Quake
sounds are originally recorded on 11 KHz, and simply playing them on higher sample
doesn't actually make them sound better. If you want to use 22 or 44 KHz sounds
at any price, I advise you to get a good editor (like SoundForge), and resample
the audio using that.

### Commands history

Added from [sons]Quake.
The last 64 console lines are stored in a file cmdhist.dat in the main Quake
folder, so than you can use cmd history after quitting/restarting the game.

### Demoplaying from .dz files

You may now use .dz files as playdemo command's parameter, it'll be
automatically extracted and played. Works from the Demos menu too.
NOTE: make sure the dzip binary (dzip.exe or dzip-linux, comes with the zip)
is present in your main Quake folder.

### Framerate independent physics

Server and Client calculates fps differently.
The server always operates at a maximum of 72 fps. This guarantees that vanilla Quake
physics are kept and also demo files remain backward compatible.
The client can operate as many fps as possible, so users can for example match their
desired max fps to their monitor's refresh rate to achieve a much smoother gameplay
experience.

## NOTE for linux GLX users

You need to have GLX installed and set up correctly. To install GLX, you need
to download the GLX drivers from your graphic card manufacturer's home page.

You also need to have `libfmod-3.73.so` (or later) to get music if you play with
Nehahra. You can get it from <http://www.fmod.org/>
