Hexen II mission Pack Utilities

HccMp is the script compiler.

Some new features are:
 - much more optimizations
 - removing uneeded stuff from progs.dat (this is turned on with -oi and -on)
 - switch statements were in but are also supported by the game now.
 - vis and light are all the same as the hexen 2 release.
 - qbsp has an increased max_planes limit. (The make files
   are now for VC 5.0)
 - genmodel has a new -opt option to cut redundant verts.
