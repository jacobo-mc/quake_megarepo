-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  To use rbtrees you'll have to implement your own insert and search cores.
  This will avoid us to use callbacks and to drop drammatically performances.
  I know it's not the cleaner way,  but in C (not in C++) to get
  performances and genericity...

  Some example of insert and search follows here. The search is a plain
  normal search over an ordered tree. The insert instead must be implemented
  int two steps: as first thing the code must insert the element in
  order as a red leaf in the tree, then the support library function
  rb_insert_color() must be called. Such function will do the
  not trivial work to rebalance the rbtree if necessary.
