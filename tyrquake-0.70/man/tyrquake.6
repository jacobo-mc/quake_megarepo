.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTyrQuake\fP is a port of \fIid Software\fP's \fBQuake\fP engine which
attempts to maintain the original look and feel of the game while also
providing support for modern platforms and user created content.

Currently \fBTyrQuake\fP is implemented as five separate programs; two
NetQuake clients (\fBtyr\-quake\fP and \fBtyr\-glquake\fP), two Quakeworld
clients (\fBtyr\-qwcl\fP and \fBtyr\-glqwcl\fP) and a Quakeworld server
(\fBtyr\-qwsv\fP). The 'gl' notation indicates the OpenGL accelerated clients
and the non-gl versions use a software-only renderer.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-heapsize n, \-mem n\fP"
Specifies the size of Quake's internal memory heap.  For historical reasons,
when using \fB\-heapsize\fP n is specified in kB and when using \fB-mem\fP n
is specified in MB.  Default 256MB.
.IP "\fB\-zone\fP"
Specifies the amount of memory in kB to reserve for Quake's dynamic memory
allocator.  Default 256kB.
.IP "\fB\-minmemory\fP"
Allocate only a minimal sized heap for Quake. If playing standard
quake (\fB\-game\fP \fIid1\fP) this is ~5.5MB, otherwise ~15.5MB.
Probably only useful for testing purposes.

.IP "\fB\-basedir\fP \fIdirectory\fP"
Specify the base directory where the Quake data is located.  The default is OS
and distribution dependent.
.IP "\fB\-game\fP \fIdirectory\fP"
Specify a game directory under \fIbasedir\fP to search for game data. Default
is \fIid1\fP.  If this option is specified, then the given \fIdirectory\fP
will be searched first, followed by \fIid1\fP.
.IP "\fB\-rogue\fP"
Set up game directories and customised HUD for use with the Rogue expansion
pack "Dissolution of Eternity".
.IP "\fB\-hipnotic\fP"
Set up game directories and customised HUD for use with the Hipnotic expansion
pack "Scourge of Armagon".

.IP "\fB\-window, \-w\fP"
Start the game in windowed mode.
.IP "\fB\-width n, \-height n\fP"
Specify the width and/or height of the game window in pixels.
.IP "\fB\-bpp n\fP (tyr-glquake,tyr-glqwcl Windows only)"
Request an OpenGL context with the specified bits-per-pixel.
.IP "\fB\-nomtex\fP"
Disable use of OpenGL Multitexture extenstions.
.IP "\fB\-nonpot\fP"
Disable use of OpenGL non-power-of-two textures.  Textures will be stretched
or padded to power-of two sizes as needed.
.IP "\fB\-noglcompression\fP"
Disable the use of compressed textures.  There is a slight quality hit when
compressed textures are enable, so use this parameter if higher quality at the
expense of more memory usage is preferred.
.IP "\fB\-gamma n\fP"
Set the video gamma value. Default 1.0.
.IP "\fB\-fullsbar\fP (tyr-glquake,tyr-glqwcl Windows only)"
Work around for buggy use of double/triple buffers and glClear.  Force the
renderer to redraw the full status bar every frame.
.IP "\fB\-noautostrectch\fP (tyr-quake,tyr-qwcl Windows only)"
By default Quake will try to adjust up the default video mode and select a
resolution appropriate for your monitor resolution. Use this command line
switch to prevent this behaviour.
.IP "\fB\-resetwinpos\fP (tyr-quake,tyr-qwcl Windows only)"
By default Quake will try to remember the previous window position and place
the window in the same position.  Specify this command line option to reset
the window position to the top left corner of the screen.

.IP "\fB\-nomouse\fP"
Disable mouse input.
.IP "\fB\-nodinput\fP (Windows only)"
Disable direct input.
.IP "\fB\-noforcemspd\fP (Windows only)"
Don't reset the mouse speed while the game is active.
.IP "\fB\-moforcemaccel\fP (Windows only)"
Don't disable mouse acceleration while the game is active.
.IP "\fB\-noforcemparms\fP (Windows only)"
Don't change mouse parameters at all while the game is active.
.IP "\fB\-nojoy\fP (Windows only)"
Disable joystick input.

.IP "\fB\-cddev dev\fP (Linux/BSD only)"
Set the cd device filname to dev. Default /dev/cdrom.
.IP "\fB\-nocdaudio\fP"
Disable CD audio.
.IP "\fB\-noextmusic\fP"
Disable the use of music files in place of CD audio tracks.
.IP "\fB\-nosound\fP"
Disable sound support.
.IP "\fB\-simsound\fP"
Disable sound output, but still perform all mixing. For testing purposes only.
.IP "\fB\-sndbits n\fP (Linux, OSS/SDL/PulseAudio)"
Specify number of bits per sample for sound output format, 8 or 16. Default 8.
.IP "\fB\-sndspeed n (Linux, OSS/SDL/PulseAudio)\fP"
Specify sample speed for sound output. Default 11025.
.IP "\fB\-sndmono\fP (Linux, BSD only)"
Request only a single channel for sound output.
.IP "\fB\-sndstereo (Linux, BSD only)\fP"
Request stereo sound output channels (Default).
.IP "\fB\-snoforceformat\fP (Windows only)"
Do not try to set the sound format of the primary sound buffer (Direct Sound).
.IP "\fB\-primarysound\fP (Windows only)"
Mix directly into the primary sound buffer. By default, Quake will set up and
use a secondary sound buffer.
.IP "\fB\-wavonly\fP (Windows only)"
Do not initialize direct sound, use the Windows media API only.

.IP "\fB\-surfcachesize n\fP"
Explicitly set the size of the surface cache (in kB) used by the software
renderer.  By default Quake will automatically calculate a suitable size for
the screen resolution selected.
.IP "\fB\-particles n\fP"
Set the maximum number of particles supported by the renderer.  It can be
useful to increase this if debugging a leak in a map where the pointfile is
very large.  Default 2048.

.IP "\fB\-cheats\fP (tyr-qwsv only)"
Enable clients to send cheat commands.
.IP "\fB\-developer\fP"
Sets the \fBdeveloper\fP console variable to 1. Useful for getting developer
debug messages early in the init process, before config.cfg and autoexec.cfg
have been executed.
.IP "\fB\-condebug\fP"
Causes Quake to append all console messages to a file \fIqconsole.log\fP in
the current game directory. By default the log is not written.
.IP "\fB\-noconinput\fP (Linux, BSD only)"
Disables console input from stdin.
.IP "\fB\-nostdout\fP"
Disables console output on stdout.
.IP "\fB\-dedicated [n]\fP (tyr-quake, tyr-glquake only)"
Start the engine in dedicated server mode (server only, no client) supporting
up to \fIn\fP clients (\fIn\fP must be between 1 and 16). If \fB\-dedicated\fP
is the last command line argument, then the server will default to supporting
8 clients.
.IP "\fB\-listen [n]\fP (tyr-quake, tyr-glquake only)"
Start the engine in listen mode (both client and server) supporting up to
\fIn\fP clients (\fIn\fP must be between 1 and 16). If \fB\-listen\fP is not
specified, then the server will support up to 4 clients. If \fB\-listen\fP is
specified as the last command line argument, then the server will default to
supporting 8 clients.
.IP "\fB\-nolan\fP (tyr-quake, tyr-glquake only)"
Disable LAN support.
.IP "\fB\-port n\fP"
Set the UDP port that the LAN server will listen on.
.IP "\fB\-udpport\fP (tyr-quake, tyr-glquake only)"
Same as \fB\-port\fP.
.IP "\fB\-ip ip\fP"
Specify an IP address to restrict Quake to use only that address.
Note that with this enabled, if you start a server it will not be
discoverable via broadcast messages.  Players will have to connect
directly.  By default we bind to any/all interfaces so that any
connected network may be used.
.IP "\fB\-localip ip\fP"
Specify an IP address to advertise as your visible IP for network play. Use if
you need to advertise a different IP address than the one locally detected,
e.g. if you are behind NAT or similar.
.IP "\fB\-noudp\fP (tyr-quake, tyr-glquake only)"
Disables UDP networking. Essentially the same effect as \fB\-nolan\fP.

.IP "\fB\-HFILE n, \-HPARENT n, \-HCHILD n\fP (tyr-quake, tyr-glquake, Windows only)"
Originally intended for \fBQHost\fP, which as I understand provides a function
similar to screen/tmux on unix for the Quake console.  You probably don't want
to use this (and it probably doesn't even work anymore!)

Set volume level for background music.  Valid values are between 0.0 (off) and
1.0 (full volume).  Default 1.0.
.IP "\fBbgm_extmusic\fP"
If set to 1, then external music files will be used in place of CD audio if
available.  Files should be placed in a 'music' directory, within the game
directory (e.g. id1/music).  CD tracks should be named track02.<ext>,
track03.<ext>, etc. where '<ext>' is one of the supported file extensions
(ogg, mp3, flac, wav).  E.g. id1/music/track02.flac.  Music files may also be
placed inside pack files using the same relative paths.  Default 1.
.IP "\fBmusic_loop\fP"
If set to 1 then external music files will loop.  If set to 0, music files
play once and then stop.  Default 1.

If 1, allow use of non-power-of-two sized textures in OpenGL (if the ARB
extension is advertised).  Set to zero to force stretching/padding of textures
to power-of-two sizes.  Default 1.
.IP "\fBgl_texture_anisotropy\fP"
Set the degree of anisotropic filtering applied to textures.  Higher
numbers will give sharper detail to surfaces that are at sharper
angles to the screen at the cost of some performance.  1 is the lower
bound, which is effectively disabled.  Drivers/hardware determine the
upper limit.  Default 1.0f.

Controls the amount of warping taking place.  Higher values warp more
and lower values less.  Default 2.
.IP "\fBr_warpscale\fP"
Controls the amount of movement in the warping surface.  Higher values
move the surface more, lower values less.  Default 8.
.IP "\fBr_particle_scale\fP"
Scale the size of particles on the screen.  Values greater than one
increase the size and values less than one decrease the size.  Default
1.

Controls drawing the player's weapon model in the view.  When 1, the
weapon is drawn.  When zero, no weapon is drawn.  If a fractional
value less than one is set, the weapon will be drawn translucent.
Default 1.

This is mostly a legacy setting that was used to allow the software
render to render more complex scenes.  Now the engine will
automatically adjust the resources as needed if it encounters more
complex scenes.  However, these settings remain available if you wish
to preempt the auto-adjustment and allow for more complex scenes right
away to avoid the frame or two of latency as the engine automatically
adjusts.  In effect, these are now minimum settings as the engine will
adjust upwards automatically as-needed.  Defaults 768/2304.

.IP "\fBscr_fov\fP"

.IP "\fBscr_conspeed\fP"
.IP "\fBscr_hudscale\fP"
Scale the console text and status bar by some factor.  When set to 1,
the console text and status bar pics are drawn at their pixel size.
This can be very small when using a high resolution video mode.  Setting
to 2 will make the text twice as big, etc.  Fractional values > 1 are
allowed.  If set to zero, the engine will try to pick a reasonable size
based on the video mode.  Can be queried/set via the \fIhudscale\fP
command.  Default 0.
.IP "\fBscr_sbaralpha\fP"
Set to a value between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque) to
draw the status bar semi-transparently.  Default 0.75.

.IP "\fBsnd_noextraupdate\fP"
.IP "\fBsnd_show\fP"
.IP "\fBsnd_crossfade_effects\fP"
When enabled, entity sounds that are cut off by another sound starting
will fade out very quickly and smoothly instead of cutting off
suddenly, as long as a sound channel is available to do so.  This
avoids some audio artifacts that can otherwise be heard if the cut off
is instantaneous.  Default 1.
.IP "\fBsnd_filterquality\fP"
Set to an integer value between 1 and 5 to control the quality of the sound
filter used when resampling audio.  1 is the fastest but lowest quality and 5
is the highest quality, but slowest.  Set to 0 to completely disable audio
filtering.  Default 3.
.IP "\fB_snd_mixahead\fP"
Specifies how far ahead (in seconds) to mix sound effects.  Lower values
provide better audio latency, while higher values help prevent audio skipping
when framerate drops.  Default 0.1.
.IP "\fBsys_nostdout\fP"

.IP "\fBvid_fullscreen\fP"
If set to 1, switch to fullscreen mode on the next \fIvid_restart\fP.  Default
0.
.IP "\fBvid_width\fP, \fBvid_height\fP"
Specifies the width and height in pixels of the window or fullscreen mode to
set on the next \fIvid_restart\fP.  Default 800 x 600.
.IP "\fBvid_bpp\fP"
Specifies the color depth of the display mode to be set on the next
\fIvid_restart\fP.  Valid values depend on the system, but typically 32, 16 or
8.  Default 32.
.IP "\fBvid_refreshrate\fP"
Specifies the refresh rate of the display mode to be set on the next
\fIvid_restart\fP.  Ignored for windowed modes.  Valid values depend on the
system.  Default 60.
.IP "\fBvid_vsync\fP"
When 0, rendering occurs as fast as possible with no synchronization to
vertical refresh.  When '1', synchronize display of frames with vertical
refresh to avoid tearing.  When '2', use 'adaptive vsync' - wait for vertical
refresh to display the frame if the rendering completed ahead of the vertical
refresh.  If rendering was slower than the vertical refresh, display
immediately.  Not all modes are supported on all systems.  Default '1'.
.IP "\fBvid_render_resolution_scale\fP"
Optionally scales up the pixel size rendered by the software renderer to
improve performance or for aesthetic preference.  When 1 (default), renders
each pixel of the window individually.  When 2 the rendered pixel size is 2x2
so only 1/4 of the work is required by the 3d renderer.  For example with an
800x600 window and scale set to 2, the render will draw the scene at 400x300
and scale up the pixels by 2 to fill the window.  When set to 0, the render
resolution is specified by the \fIvid_render_resolution_width\fP and
\fIvid_render_resolution_height\fP variables manually.  Default 1.
.IP "\fBvid_render_resolution_width\fP, \fBvid_render_resolution_height\fP"
When \fIvid_render_resolution_scale\fP is 0, sets the width and height of the
resolution to render the scene at which will then be stretched up to the
window or screen size.  Default 320 x 200.
.IP "\fBvid_window_centered\fP"
When 1, place the window centered on the screen.  When 0, either use the
previously remembered position if \fIvid_window_remember_position\fP is 1,
otherwise allow the window manager to place the window.  Default 1.
.IP "\fBvid_window_remember_position\fP"
When 1, record the placement of the game window in the \fIvid_window_x\fP and
\fIvid_window_y\fP console variables so the position can be restored next time
the game starts or restarts.  Note that if \fIvid_window_centered\fP is 1,
then the window will be centered and the remembered position will be ignored.
Default 1.
.IP "\fBvid_window_x\fP"
.IP "\fBvid_window_y\fP"
Records the window position of the application at the time it was last closed.
