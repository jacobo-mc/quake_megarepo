Hexen 2 Source Code Release Info
--------------------------------

The H2MP directory contains the source code for the Hexen2 Mission Pack.  The mission pack
code contains within it the original Hexen2 code, bug fixes that were released for the patches,
and the code changes necessary for the mission pack.  

The H2W directory contains the Hexen2World source code.  While I have worked on further changes
beyond what is included in this directory, they are not stable enough to be released.

The source code was compiled last under Visual C++ V5.x, so there may be some changes necessary 
in order to get it to work under VC6.x.  I included the original versions of the DirectX and 
SciTech libraries that we used, you may be able to use later versions.

This code is delivered AS IS, as Raven will not be providing any support.  Please refer to the Quake
Standards Group web site, http://www.quakesrc.org, for future support / tutorials on this source 
code release.
